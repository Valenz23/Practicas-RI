In the past decade it is widely reported that the cobalt aluminate has been detected in ancient ceramics as blue colorant in glaze, yet the acquired Raman spectra are incredibly different from that of synthesised references, necessitating a reassessment of such contradictory scenario with more accurate analytic strategies. In this study, micro-Raman spectroscopy (MRS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in association with energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) were performed on under-glaze cobalt pigments from one submerged blue and white porcelain shard dated from Wanli reign (1573–1620 CE) of Ming dynasty (1365–1644 CE) excavated at Nan'ao I shipwreck off the southern coast of China. The micro-structural inspection reveals that the pigment particles have characteristics of small account, tiny size, heterogeneously distribution, and more importantly, been completely enwrapped by well-developed anorthite crystals in the glaze, indicating that the signals recorded in previous publications are probably not from cobalt pigments themselves but from outside thickset anorthite shell. The further spectromicroscopic analyses confirm this presumption when the accurate spectra of cobalt aluminate pigment and surrounding anorthite were obtained separately with precise optical positioning. Accordingly, we reassess and clarify the previous Raman studies dedicated to cobalt blue pigment in ancient ceramics, e.g. cobalt blue in celadon glaze, and in turn demonstrate the superiority and necessity of coupling spectroscopic analysis with corresponding structure observation, especially in the characterization of pigments from complicated physico-chemical environment like antiquities. Thus, this study promotes a better understanding of Raman spectroscopy study of cobalt blue pigments in art and archaeology field. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8); Blue and white porcelain; Cobalt blue (CoAl2O4); Under-glaze decoration; μ-Raman","Ceramic materials; Chemical analysis; Cobalt; Glazes; Raman spectroscopy; Scanning electron microscopy; Spectroscopic analysis; Anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8); Blue and white porcelains; Cobalt blue; Energy dispersive spectrometry; Micro Raman Spectroscopy; Micro-structural; Physico-chemicals; Pigment particles; Porcelain",2-s2.0-85029105108

However, contemporary research on the digital divide struggles to link historical legacies of uneven development, as well as social justice strategies, with digital participation in urban spaces. By examining contemporary digital art that critiques the spatial inequalities encountered by U.S. racial minorities, this article illustrates how public intellectuals use ICTs in ways that draw upon past strategies to territorialize space for political ends. It focuses on digital pop-ups, open-air installations that cast images onto public space using projectors. Historicizing these new efforts illustrates a continuity of tactics engaged by communities of color in response to socio-spatial inequalities in the urban United States, such as the 1970s mural movement’s efforts to re-politicize spaces of exclusion. While existing literature finds that digital inequality results in differential digital human capital, this research indicates that place-based claims, such as digital pop-ups, are important sites for combatting racial injustice and creating more inclusionary spaces, especially among youth adults. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","digital arts; Digital divide; race; urban studies; young people",,2-s2.0-85008230306

The main objective is to identify new concepts for fatigue life estimation other than the classical models and their hybrids. Various techniques to estimate fatigue life have been identified, such as critical plane deviation, 5D deviatoric space enclosed surface, modified Wholer curve. However, the most notable one to be found is the application of evolutionary optimization algorithms for, e.g., genetic algorithms, artificial neural networking, and differential ant-stigmergy algorithms. Initially, a brief history of fatigue life estimation and modeling is presented. In subsequent sections, some familiar classical models are discussed, and then various innovative approaches to fatigue life prediction are reviewed. The survey is fairly detailed, and best efforts have been made to the net in as many new methodologies as possible. The review is organized to offer insight on how past research efforts have provided the groundwork for subsequent studies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Classical fatigue models; Critical plane; Fatigue; Hybrid models; Optimization algorithm",,2-s2.0-85030700984

Capacitance resistance model (CRM) simulates water flooding performance based on two tuning parameters of time constant and connectivity. Main advantages of CRM are its simplicity and fastness; furthermore, it needs only some field-available inputs like injection and production flow rates. CRM is reliable if producers receive the injection rate signal; in other words, duration of history matching must be enough so that the rate signal of injection is sensed in producers. It is a shortcoming of CRM that the results might not be accurate as a result of short history. In the common CRM, time constant is considered to be a static parameter (constant number) during the history of simulation. However, time constant is a time-dependent function that depends on the reservoir nature. In this paper, a new model has been developed as it decreases model dependency on the history matching length by shifting time axis. This new definition adds a rate shift constant to the model mathematics. Moreover, a new model is considering dynamic time constants. This new model is called dynamic capacitance resistance model (DCRM). Two reservoir models have been simulated to analyze the performance of DCRM, and, as a result, it is found that the static time constant is an erroneous assumption. Finally, the accuracy of the results has been improved since the degree-of-freedom of the CRM increased in the new version.

It is known that the risk of congenital malformations in a multiple pregnancy are higher than single pregnancy. The aim of this study is to compare congenital malformations in singleton infants conceived by ART to singleton infants conceived naturally. Materials and Methods: In this historical cohort study, we performed a historical cohort study of major congenital malformations (MCM) in 820 singleton births from January 2012 to December 2014. The data for this analysis were derived from Tehran’s ART linked data file. The risk of congenital malformations was compared in 164 ART infants and 656 NC infants. We performed multiple logistic regression analyses for the independent association of ART on each outcome. Results: We found 40 infants with MCM 29 (4.4%) NC infants and 14 (8.3%) ART infants. In comparison with NC infants, ART infants had a significant 2-fold increased risk of MCM (P=0.046). After adjusting individually for maternal age, infant gender, prior stillbirth, mother’s history of spontaneous abortion, and type of delivery, we did not find any difference in risk. In this study the majority (95.1%) of all infants were normal but 4.9% of infants had at least one MCM. We found a difference in risk of MCMs between in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). We excluded the possible role of genotype and other unknown factors in causing more malformations in ART infants. Conclusion: This study reported a higher risk of MCMs in ART singleton infants than in NC singleton infants. Congenital heart disease, developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), and urogenital malformations were the most reported major malformations in singleton ART infants according to organ and system classification. © 2017, Royan Institute (ACECR).

Proviral DNA resistance testing in 69 virologically suppressed patients on antiretroviral treatment with no history of virological failure were pair-wised compared with pre-ART plasma RNA resistance testing. The median time between plasma (RNA testing) and whole blood (proviral DNA testing) was 47 months (IQR 29–63).

These algorithms are constructed based on similarity between users and/or items (e.g., a user is likely to purchase the same items as his/her most similar users). In this work, we introduce a novel time-aware recommendation algorithm that is based on identifying overlapping community structure among users. Users’ interests might change over time, and accurate modeling of dynamic users’ preferences is a challenging issue in designing efficient personalized recommendation systems. The users–items interaction network is often highly sparse in real systems, for which many recommenders fail to provide accurate predictions. The proposed overlapping community structure amongst the users helps in minimizing the sparsity effects. We apply the proposed algorithm on two real-world benchmark datasets and show that it overcomes these challenges.

Today, phishing attack is one of the most common and serious threats over Internet where cyber attackers try to steal user’s personal or financial credentials by using either malwares or social engineering. Detection of phishing attacks with high accuracy has always been an issue of great interest. Recent developments in phishing detection techniques have led to various new techniques, specially designed for phishing detection where accuracy is extremely important. Phishing problem is widely present as there are several ways to carry out such an attack, which implies that one solution is not adequate to address it. Two main issues are addressed in our paper. First, we discuss in detail phishing attacks, history of phishing attacks and motivation of attacker behind performing this attack. In addition, we also provide taxonomy of various types of phishing attacks. Second, we provide taxonomy of various solutions proposed in the literature to detect and defend from phishing attacks. In addition, we also discuss various issues and challenges faced in dealing with phishing attacks and spear phishing and how phishing is now targeting the emerging domain of IoT. We discuss various tools and datasets that are used by the researchers for the evaluation of their approaches. This provides better understanding of the problem, current solution space and future research scope to efficiently deal with such attacks. © 2016, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.","Bag-of-word; Data mining; Key logger; Machine learning; Malware; Phishing; Social engineering; Soft computing; Spam; Visual similarity","Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Internet; Learning systems; Malware; Soft computing; Taxonomies; Bag of words; Phishing; Social engineering; Spam; Visual similarity; Computer crime",2-s2.0-84961211997

In this study, a mixture of 90% CH4/10% C2H6 diluted in 99% Ar was studied at fuel lean (equiv. ratio = 0.5) conditions, for pressures around 1, 4, and 10 atm. Using laser absorption diagnostics, the time histories of CO and H2O were recorded between 1400 and 1800 K. Water is a final product from combustion, and its formation is a good marker of the completion of the combustion process. Carbon monoxide is an intermediate combustion species, a good marker of incomplete/inefficient combustion, as well as a regulated pollutant for the gas turbine industry. Measurements such as these species time histories are important for validating and assessing chemical kinetics models beyond just ignition delay times and laminar flame speeds. Time-history profiles for these two molecules were compared to a state-of-the-art detailed kinetics mechanism as well as to the well-established GRI 3.0 mechanism. Results show that the H2O profile is accurately reproduced by both models. However, discrepancies are observed for the CO profiles. Under the conditions of this study, the CO profiles typically increase rapidly after an induction time, reach a maximum, and then decrease. This maximum CO mole fraction is often largely over-predicted by the models, whereas the depletion rate of CO past this peak is often over-estimated for pressures above 1 atm.

The purpose of this study is to provide knowledge about the importance of mitochondrial dysfunction, dysregulated lipid metabolism and inflammation. Mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1a (CPT1a) is a key molecule involved in lipid metabolism and mutations in CPT1a causing reduced function is hypothesized to have a protective role in the development of depression. Moreover, CPT1a is found to be upregulated in suicide patients with history of depression. Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibition of CPT1a activity can be developed as an innovative treatment strategy for depression. Stress exposure combined with different pharmacological treatment regimens; Etomoxir, CPT1 blocker, and Escitalopram, a favoured antidepressant drug, was applied in state-of-the-art chronic mild stress model. Etomoxir treatment induced statistical significant reduction of anhedonic behavior compared to vehicle treatment (p < 0.0001) and reversed depression-like phenotype in 90% of the rats (p = 0.0007), whereas Escitalopram only proved 57% efficacy. Moreover, Etomoxir revealed downregulation of interferon-γ, interleukin-17α and tumor necrosis factor-α. This indicate that alteration in metabolism is pivotal in the pathogenesis of depression, since CPT1 blockage is highly efficient in treating anhedonia and inflammation, thereby opening up for a novel class of antidepressant medication. © The Author(s) 2017.",,,2-s2.0-85019917762

Although most of these algorithms used a single mutation strategy, several with multiple mutation strategies have recently been proposed. Multiple-operator-based algorithms have been proven to be more effective and efficient than single-operator-based algorithms for solving a wide range of benchmark and practical problems. In these algorithms, adaptive operator selection mechanisms are generally applied to place greater emphasis on the best-performing evolutionary operators based on their performance histories for generating new offspring. In this paper, we investigate using problem landscape information in an adaptive operator selection mechanism. For this purpose, a new algorithm, which considers both this problem landscape information and the performance histories of the operators, for dynamically selecting the most suitable differential evolution operator during the evolutionary process, is proposed. The contributions of each component of the selection mechanism are analyzed and the performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by solving 45 unconstrained optimization problems.

Comprising mostly unreinforced, load-bearing masonry, heritage buildings may date anywhere from antiquity to the 19th and early 20th century. Being exposed to the elements over the years, they are in various states of disrepair and material degradation. Based on postearthquake reconnaissance reports, these structures occasionally behave rather poorly, even in moderate seismic events, undergoing catastrophic damage and collapse, whereas retrofitting is governed by international conventions regarding noninvasiveness and reversibility of the intervention. The complexity of their structural systems (continuous structural components, lack of diaphragm action, material brittleness, and variability) challenges the established methods of condition assessment of preretrofitted and postretrofitted heritage constructions. The most advanced state of the art in materials and analysis tools is required, far more complex than with conventional buildings. Thus, an assessment procedure specifically geared to this class of structures is urgently needed, in order to assist engineers in this endeavor. The objective of this paper is the development of a performance-based assessment framework that is palatable to practitioners and quite accurate in seismic assessment of unreinforced masonry buildings with no diaphragm action. The underlying theoretical background of the method is illustrated with reference to first principles: global demand is obtained from the design earthquake scenario for the region, using empirical estimates for the prevailing translational period of the system; deformation demands are localized using an approximation to the translational 3-D shape of lateral response, estimated using a uniform gravitational field in the direction of action of the earthquake; acceptance criteria are specified in terms of relative drift ratios, referring to the in-plane and the out-of-plane action of the masonry piers. The quantitative accuracy of the introduced procedure is evaluated through comparison with detailed time-history dynamic analysis results, using a real life example case study. Qualitative relevance of the results is evaluated through comparison of the location and extent of anticipated damage estimated from the proposed assessment procedure, with reported records of the building damages that occurred during a significant past earthquake event.

The medical usage of the term is no more and no less metaphorical than in the entire history of explanations of how beliefs circulate in social interactions. The circulation of such communicable diseases and the circulation of ideas are both material and experiential. Diseases and ideas expose the power and danger of bodies in contact, as well as the fragility and tenacity of social bonds. In the case of the theatre, various tropes of contagion are to be found in both the fictional world on the stage (at least since Sophocles' Oedipus Rex) and in many theories defining the rules of interaction between theatre audiences, fictitious characters and/or performers. In consequence, the historically changing concept of contagion has in many respects influenced how mimesis was conceived and understood. The main goal of my article is to demonstrate how the concept of contagion has changed over the last few decades and how it may influence our understanding of the idea of mimesis and participation in performative arts. This will be achieved in two steps. Firstly, I will compare the concept of contagion as the outbreak narrative that had influenced, among others, Antonin Artaud's The Theater and the Plague with the more recent and dynamic concept of epidemic structured around the tipping point. Secondly, I will look for performative art forms with similar structure of audience responses, analyzing Mariano Pensotti's project Sometimes I Think, I Can See You (2010), in order to demonstrate new forms of performativity and (re)presentation. © 2017 Małgorzata Sugiera, published by De Gruyter Open 2017.","contagion as communicable disease; epidemic as metaphor; mimesis; participation in performative arts; the tipping point",,2-s2.0-85032741708

This article looks at cultural politics in India at two critical moments of its history: in the 1950s, when major state institutions of culture – the Akademis, the National School of Drama, etc – were first established under the ‘liberal’ aegis of the Nehruvian administration; and at the turn of the 1990s, when these institutions might be said to be undergoing a certain crisis owing to major shifts in the governmental arrangement, accompanied by severe challenges from civil society groups and the right. Taking up the relevant archives – the cultural seminars on dance, music, drama and film hosted by the Indian government in the 1950s; the artist-activist group Sahmat; the Haksar Committee deliberations of 1988–1989 – the article argues that this modernist vision of censorship as a form of interference in what is otherwise the potential, pure transmissibility of speech, is a fallacy. Censorship is inherent in any social contract. To the extent that each of the above institutions were created to instigate and support a culture and aesthetics of freedom, to the extent that they were mandated to infuse various cultural forms of the country with the liberal constitutional spirit, they also represent mandates for censorship. Rather than describing censorship in terms of ‘vertical’ prophylaxes between above and below, the article argues that censorship must be seen rather as a dissipated force, appearing where certain concentrations of power or agreements establish themselves, even if, or rather precisely, in the interest of supporting the liberal or inclusive ethos of free speech. © 2017 Third Text","Akademis; Arindam Dutta; censorship; dissipation; drama; Haksar Committee; limits of free speech; Sahmat; social contract",,2-s2.0-85032669462

The modal characteristics are then used to update the finite element model. The nonlinear suspension components are identified using the experimentally obtained response spectra for each of the components tested separately.

Next, reflecting on the research done by a 14 country network I direct – Consortium on Emerging Directions in Audience Research (CEDAR), funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, United Kingdom – I examine the features of this decade of transformation, paying attention to the intellectual markers that punctuate this decade and make it stand out in the history of audience studies. I focus on four pivotal axes of transformations which emerge out of the analysis conducted by the CEDAR network and argue that these four represent significant ways in which audience analysis has lived through an uncertain but exciting decade. These axes are audiences’ changing coping strategies with hyper-connected and intrusive media, audience interruptions of media content flows, the co-option of audience labour, and the micro–macro politics of audience action. I conclude by locating this transformative decade 2004–2014 against a longer backdrop of uncertain moments and periods of flux in the field, arguing, that not unlike those points in time, now too, audience analysis has reached a newer, more unknown, but very significant phase. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","audience research; audiences; cedar; new media; reception; transforming audiences",,2-s2.0-85031421754

Knowledge of HBV status is important to guide optimal selection of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and monitor/prevent liver-related complications. We describe changes in testing practices and management of HBV infection over a 3-year period in HIV clinics across SSA. Methods: A medical chart review was conducted in large urban HIV treatment centers in Côte d'Ivoire (3 sites), Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Kenya, Senegal, South Africa, Togo, Uganda and Zambia (1 site each). Of the patients who started ART between 2010 and 2012, 100 per year were randomly selected from each clinic. Demographic, clinical and laboratory information as well as individual treatment histories were collected using a standardized questionnaire. We examined changes over time in the proportion of patients screened for HBV infection (HBV surface antigen [HBsAg]-positivity), identified predictors of HBV testing using logistic regression, and assessed the proportion of patients initiating a tenofovir (TDF)-containing ART regimen. Results: Overall, 3579 charts of patients initiating ART (64.4% female, median age 37years) were reviewed in 12 clinics. The proportion of patients screened for HBsAg increased from 17.8% in 2010 to 24.4% in 2012 overall, and ranged from 0.7% in Kenya to 96% in South Africa. In multivariable analyses, age and region were associated with HBsAg screening. Among 759 individuals tested, 88 (11.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 9.4-14.1) were HBV-infected, of whom 71 (80.7%) received a TDF-containing ART regimen. HBsAg-positive individuals were twice as likely to receive a TDF-containing first-line ART regimen compared to HBsAg-negative patients (80.7% vs. 40.3%, p<0.001). The proportion of patients on TDF-containing ART increased from 57.9% in 2010 to 90.2% in 2012 in HIV/HBV-co-infected patients (Chi-2 test for trend: p=0.01). Only 114 (5.0%) patients were screened for anti-HCV antibodies and one of them (0.9%, 95% CI 0.02-4.79) had a confirmed HCV infection. Conclusions: The systematic screening for HBV infection in HIV-positive patients before ART initiation was limited in most African countries and its uptake varied widely across clinics. Overall, the prescription of TDF increased over time, with 90% of HIV/HBV-coinfected patients receiving this drug in 2012. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85017497619

Building on Krauss’s analysis, this essay argues for the continuing usefulness of the concept of medium in relation to the work of the Spanish sculptor Juan Muñoz (1953-2001), and proposes a critical and historical interpretation of The Wasteland (1986), the first of a number of sculptural installations by Muñoz incorporating ‘optical floors’. The essay shows how Muñoz’s technical dialogue with artistic tradition, through his play on opticality and ventriloquism, is integral to The Wasteland’s engagement with history and memory. Muñoz’s early, unpublished interview with Richard Serra, read in conjunction with a hitherto overlooked essay by Muñoz, offers valuable insights into the way in which Muñoz conceptualized that engagement. The essay proposes a view of medium in Muñoz’s work as fundamentally anti-formalist and ventriloquial.

We therefore assessed the association between alcohol type and plasma HIV RNA level (HIV viral load) among HIV-infected drinkers not on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Russia and Uganda. We analyzed the data of participants from cohorts in Russia and Uganda and assessed their HIV viral load at enrollment by the alcohol type predominantly consumed. We defined predominant alcohol type as the alcohol type contributing &gt;50% of total alcohol consumption in the 1 month (Russia) or 3 months (Uganda) prior to enrollment. Using multiple linear regression, we compared log10 HIV viral load by predominant alcohol type, controlling for age, gender, socioeconomic status, total number of standard drinks, frequency of drinking ≥6 drinks/occasion, and in Russia, history of injection drug use. Most participants (99.2% of 261 in Russia and 98.9% of 352 in Uganda) predominantly drank one alcohol type. In Russia, we did not find evidence for differences in viral load levels between drinkers of fortified wine (n = 5) or hard liquor (n = 49), compared to drinkers of beer/low-ethanol-content cocktails (n = 163); however, wine/high-ethanol-content cocktail drinkers (n = 42) had higher mean log10 viral load than beer/low-ethanol-content cocktail drinkers (β = 0.38, 95% CI 0.07–0.69; p = 0.02). In Uganda, we did not find evidence for differences in viral load levels between drinkers of locally-brewed beer (n = 41), commercially-distilled spirits (n = 38), or locally-distilled spirits (n = 43), compared to drinkers of commercially-made beer (n = 218); however, wine drinkers (n = 8) had lower mean log10 HIV viral load (β = −0.65, 95% CI −1.36 to 0.07, p = 0.08), although this did not reach statistical significance. Among HIV-infected drinkers not yet on ART in Russia and Uganda, we observed an association between the alcohol type predominantly consumed and the HIV viral load level in the Russia sample.

Many pieces of art can be admired in museums around the world standing on beautiful stones. However, in very few cases are the stones given correct recognition or names. In general, they are all labelled as “marble”. Illustrative examples can be provided from museums in Salamanca, Spain: Museum Casa Lis but, also, and, briefly, the museum Mateo Hernández. The first of these is a very prestigious museum where a superb collection of Art Nouveau and Art Decó sculptures can be admired. Among them are many chryselephantine: sculptures made of ivory, bronze and other materials dating from the European nineteenth century art, placed on plinths of natural stone. Our work has identified, as accurately as possible, those stones. Most of the natural stones used as pedestals consist of onyx, but there are many other stones, ranging from serpentinite to travertine as well as some, as yet, unidentified materials. The second museum, Mateo Hernández, houses a large collection of sculptures by this local artist. The sculptor used different kind of stones, but mainly “Petit Granit”, from Belgium. Despite the trade name, it is actually a type of limestone, but most museum catalogues have translated the name as “Black Granite”. The aim of our work is to help curators to correctly describe stones. The character of the natural stone is related to the aesthetic qualities and history of the sculpture. But proper identification of the stone can also contribute to important work for earth scientists: to disseminate understanding of the importance of natural stones, historical quarries and geoheritage among the general public. © 2017 The European Association for Conservation of the Geological Heritage","Art museums; Geoheritage; Museo Casa Lis; Museo Mateo Hernández; Natural stones",,2-s2.0-85032705131

Dealing with the dilemma of locating marginalized voices in archival collections, scholars have recognized that in order to address the paucity of records on disadvantaged communities, the parameters of what ordinarily would be considered the ‘historical archive’ have to be enlarged. Over the past decades a number of embroidery projects have been established in previously disadvantaged communities in South Africa, focusing specifically on black women. Proponents of these projects claim that the construction of story cloths involves the active participation of a community in documenting and making accessible the history of their particular group on their own terms and in providing them with previously denied participation in the archival process. This article will look at the Mogalakwena Craft Art Development Foundation embroidered story cloth project as an example of such an archive that could contribute in the writing of a more inclusive history and add another perspective to the history of South Africa. © 2017 Archives and Records Association","alternative archival sources; archival participation; community archiving; embroidered story cloths; inclusive history; Under-documented communities",,2-s2.0-85032820402

It is unclear how the risk varies as exposure accumulates. Methods: Using an administrative health-plan dataset, risk of cardiovascular disease events (CVDe), defined as the first episode of an acute myocardial infarction or a coronary intervention procedure, associated with abacavir exposure was assessed among HIV-infected individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy across the U.S. from October 2009 through December 2014. The data were longitudinal, and analyzed using marginal structural models. Results: Over 114,470 person-years (n = 72,733) of ART exposure, 714 CVDe occurred at an incidence rate (IR) (95% CI) of 6·23 (5·80, 6·71)/1000 person-years. Individuals exposed to abacavir had a higher IR of CVDe of 9·74 (8·24, 11·52)/1000 person-years as compared to 5·75 (5·30, 6·24)/1000 person-years for those exposed to other antiretroviral agents. The hazard (HR; 95% CI) of CVDe was increased for current (1·43; 1·18, 1·73), recent (1·41; 1·16, 1·70), and cumulative [(1·18; 1·06, 1·31) per year] exposure to abacavir. The risk for cumulative exposure followed a bell-shaped dose-response curve peaking at 24-months of exposure. Risk was similarly elevated among participants free of pre-existing heart disease or history of illicit substance use at baseline. Conclusion: Current, recent, and cumulative use of abacavir was associated with an increased risk of CVDe.

As such, it can only be done critically and in an argumentative manner. The mere repristination of authorities or traditional language patterns would not do. From the perspective of a church historian, this raises the expectation that dogmatics treats the question which issues and arguments (from the past) should be considered relevant for a present reformulation of faith and should be continued. Dogmatic theology describes texts as regards the evaluation of the arguments and suppositions contained within, but it should refrain from extracting corresponding ""systems"" from all texts or from compiling statements according to its own order. Rather carefully selected text passages should be treated in their argumentative style, historical context and related interests with philological precision. The respective status of historical research in the exegetical disciplines and church history should be taken into consideration, even if this means that dogmatics has to adjust its arguments again and again to the actual state of the art.

In this article, I explore the historical roots of this concept in the biology of the time, which was then still searching for the right concepts to describe the organic. Bildungstrieb is found in Kant’s teleology in the Critique of Judgment, where Kant with the help of this concept works out the specificity of organic life as well as its vicinity and difference to the teleology of human acts and action. Kant himself refers to the Göttingen anatomist, zoologist, and anthropologist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, in whose writings Kant found the term which he reinterpreted for his own purposes. Friedrich Schiller adopts the word Bildungstrieb in his work On the Esthetic Education of Man in a Series of Letters, reinterpreting it from the point of view of the history of ideas. It is Friedrich Hölderlin, finally, who in his Essay The Perspective from which We Have to Look at Antiquity, and in related texts, gives the Bildungstrieb an important role. The Bildungstrieb needs to be awakened, if art is going to draw in an original way from an undeformed source. During work on the tragedy The Death of Empedocles, the poet further developed the concept of Bildungstrieb to include the idea of an opposition between what he calls the ‘aorgic’ and the ‘organic’, which mutually condition, complete, and penetrate one another, in a manner similar to Nietzsche’s even more powerful formulation of the Janus-faced artistic impulse, as embodied in the opposition of the Dionysian and the Apollonian. © 2017 The Author(s).

Timeaware Point-of-Interest(POI) recommendation is one of the most important location-aware services, which can recommend locations to a target user at the specific time based on check-in history. However, current techniques ignore user&#x2019;s mobility within a region, which plays a vital role in the POI chosen decision. Most of existing algorithms fail to capture the latent relations behind the temporal factors and geographical influence. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid Time-aware POI Recommendation model based on User Mobility: TPR-UM, which improves the POI recommendation accuracy greatly. More specifically, by introducing the implicit region factor, we capture users&#x2019; mobility through collective user actions and geographical properties of locations. We generate the check-in patterns based on different time intervals and different regions to exploit the latent relations between temporal factors and geographical influence. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on two real-world datasets, Gowalla and Foursquare. The experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid method is effective and outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of precision, recall and F&#x03B2; measurement.

Is this ethically problematic? Is it deception? And what kind of “reality” do we presuppose when we talk about illusion in this context? Inspired by work on similarities between ICT design and the art of magic and illusion, responding to literature on deception in robot ethics and related fields, and briefly considering the issue in the context of the history of machines, this paper discusses these questions through the lens of stage magic and illusionism, with the aim of reframing the very question of deception. It investigates if we can take a more positive or at least morally neutral view of magic, illusion, and performance, while still being able to understand and criticize the relevant phenomena, and if we can describe and evaluate these phenomena without recourse to the term “deception” at all. This leads the paper into a discussion about metaphysics and into taking a relational and narrative turn. Replying to Tognazzini, the paper identifies and analyses two metaphysical positions: a narrative and performative non-dualist position is articulated in response to what is taken to be a dualist, in particular Platonic, approach to “deception” phenomena. The latter is critically discussed and replaced by a performative and relational approach which avoids a distant “view from nowhere” metaphysics and brings us back to the phenomena and experience in the performance relation. The paper also reflects on the ethical and political implications of the two positions: for the responsibility of ICT designers and users, which are seen as co-responsible magicians or co-performers, and for the responsibility of those who influence the social structures that shape who has (more) power to deceive or to let others perform. © 2017 The Author(s)","Deception; Ethics; ICTs; Magic; Performance; Politics","Computer games; Machine design; Ontology; Deception; Ethics; ICTs; Magic; Performance; Politics; Philosophical aspects",2-s2.0-85031771687

We attempt to rank parameters derived from past history and diagnostic results with regard to the prognosis. Methods: Observational trial on 719 consecutive couples who were referred to a tertiary immunological care centre (2006–2014) after three or more primary miscarriages. Information on past obstetric history and diagnostic procedures at baseline were correlated with cumulative pregnancy and delivery rates using Kaplan–Meier estimation, logistic regression and multivariate analysis. Results: At baseline, median female age was 34.1 years, waiting time 3 years (1–17), number of preceding miscarriages 3 (3–9), 147 women (20.4%) had conceived at least once in ART or AIH cycles. After a median follow-up of 33.7 (1.7–123.0) months, 5-year pregnancy and delivery rates were 86.1 and 64.5%. Female age (&lt; 35 years), waiting time (&lt; 3 years) until baseline, tubal competence, and male factor fertility significantly correlated with favourable outcome (p &lt; 0.001), while body mass index (&gt; 29 kg/m2), number of preceding miscarriages (&gt; 4), late miscarriages, preclinical losses and smoking revealed non-significant negative trends. Mode of conception until baseline (spontaneously or ART/AIH) and classification into idiopathic and non-idiopathic RPL showed no prognostic relevance. Conclusion: Although in general, chances to conceive a child are retained after three or more miscarriages, factors related to subfertility of both partners have an important impact on the outcome. Therefore, prolonged time to pregnancy (&gt; 6–9 months) should result in preventive gynaecological care from the first miscarriage on, so that fertility can be preserved as best as possible. © 2017 The Author(s)","Artificial reproductive technologies (ART); Idiopathic; Immunotherapy; Late miscarriage; Preclinical loss; Spontaneous conception; Tubal incompetence",,2-s2.0-85031915759

Consequently, processors encounter frequent off-chip misses, and hence, lose significant performance potential. One of the components of a modern processor that has a prominent influence on the off-chip miss traffic is LLC&#x0027;s replacement policy. Existing processors employ a variation of least recently used (LRU) policy to determine the victim for replacement. Unfortunately, there is a large gap between what LRU offers and that of Belady&#x0027;s MIN, which is the optimal replacement policy. Belady&#x0027;s MIN requires selecting a victim with the longest reuse distance, and hence, is unfeasible due to the need for knowing the future. In this work, we observe that there exists a strong correlation between the expected number of hits of a cache block and the reciprocal of its reuse distance. Taking advantage of this observation, we improve the efficiency of last-level caches through a low-cost-yet-effective replacement policy. We suggest a hit-count based victim-selection procedure on top of existing low-cost replacement policies to significantly improve the quality of victim selection in last-level caches without commensurate area overhead. Our proposal offers 12.2% performance improvement over the baseline LRU in a multi-core processor and outperforms EVA, which is the state-of-the-art replacement policy.

Mattotti uses visual techniques from Expressionist art and film to create a grotesque vision of Hyde whose appearance is constantly in flux, reflecting Stevenson’s ambiguous descriptions of Hyde and making the character more frightening and unpredictable.

The present study brings together arguments that see the speaker of the poem, Beauty, as a statue, along with those that understand the poem as being fundamentally ironic. Situating ‘La Beauté’ in the context of Baudelaire’s art criticism allows us to understand it as part of his engagement in debates within the visual arts. This gives us a new reading of Beauty’s claims as voicing the positions of neo-classical idealism, and specifically those of nineteenth-century academic theorists influenced by the eighteenth-century German inventor of art history, Winckelmann. Recognizing the importance of Winckelmann in approaching this poem sheds light on the rejection of movement and emotion that is pronounced by Beauty, and which contradict Baudelaire’s theoretical positions expressed elsewhere. The sonnet is thus incorporating the language of a speaker who is distinct from the lyric ‘je’ and cannot be reduced to a mask for him or a part of his divided self. This language and the position it expresses are framed within the sonnet, whose implicit irony leads to what Bakhtin calls double voicing. This approach offers a new reading of ‘La Beauté’ in formal terms as an example of Bakhtinian dialogism within lyric poetry. © 2017 The Author(s)","Aesthetics; Anamorphosis; Art theory; Bakhtin; Baudelaire; Beauty; Delacroix; Dialogism; Ekphrasis; La Beauté; Les Fleurs du mal; Painting; Sculpture; Sonnet; Winckelmann",,2-s2.0-85031410724

This part of the river was being transformed during the period by the building of Joseph Bazzelgate’s embankment (1871–1874), tangle of railway lines at Battersea and population boom on the South side. Painting and etching close to his Cheyne Walk home, Whistler largely ignores the modernisation of the river, depicting the rickety wooden structure of Old Battersea Bridge and manual labour like that carried out by the Thames watermen. By situating the Nocturnes within the campaign to free the Metropolitan bridges from the toll and the dangerous passage lightermen had to navigate under Battersea Bridge, this article suggests that Whistler’s aestheticism remained tied to the social history of the river. After a survey of post-war art-historical accounts of the Nocturnes as (a) avant-garde negation of Victorian pictorial convention and (b) flight into the hermetic sphere of art for art’s sake, it is suggested that the withdrawal from social comment in Whistler’s painting amounts to a disengagement from the intellectual presuppositions of socially progressive ‘work’. © 2017 Konsthistoriska Sallskapet",,,2-s2.0-85031108340

Information retrieval (IR) approaches see the bug report as the query, and the source code files as the documents to be retrieved, ranked by relevance. Such approaches have the advantage of not requiring expensive static or dynamic analysis of the code. However, current state-of-the-art IR approaches rely on project history, in particular previously fixed bugs or previous versions of the source code. We present a novel approach that directly scores each current file against the given report, thus not requiring past code and reports. The scoring method is based on heuristics identified through manual inspection of a small sample of bug reports. We compare our approach to eight others, using their own five metrics on their own six open source projects. Out of 30 performance indicators, we improve 27 and equal 2. Over the projects analysed, on average we find one or more affected files in the top 10 ranked files for 76% of the bug reports. These results show the applicability of our approach to software projects without history. © 2017 The Author(s)","Bug localisation; Empirical study; Information retrieval","Codes (symbols); Computer programming languages; Heuristic methods; Information retrieval; Empirical studies; Localisation; Manual inspection; Open source projects; Performance indicators; Program comprehension; Software project; State of the art; Open source software",2-s2.0-85030839644

Filler is used in HDNR formulations to increase the dissipative capacity, and it induces also a stress softening behaviour, known as the Mullins effect. In this paper, a wide experimental campaign is carried out on a large number of virgin HDNR samples to better investigate some aspects of the stress softening behaviour, such as the direction dependence and recovery properties, and to characterize the stable and softening response under different strain histories. Test results are also used to define a model for simulating the response of HDNR bearings in shear that advances the state of the art in the description of the stress softening, which can be significant during the earthquake time history. The proposed model is used to analyse the seismic response of a simplified isolated structure modelled as an SDOF system under ground motions with different characteristics and by considering two different conditions for the bearings: one assuming the virgin (or fully recovered) rubber properties and the other assuming the stable (or fully scragged) rubber properties. The results show that, in the case of far-field records, the differences between the responses are limited although not negligible, whereas for near-fault records, modelling the bearings as being in their virgin state significantly reduces the effect of this kind of motion on isolated structures.

Patients with heart failure (HF), carotid occlusive disease (COD), and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) present themselves with complaints attributed to specific parts of the heart-brain axis, but hemodynamic changes often go beyond the part of the axis for which they primarily seek medical advice. The Heart-Brain Study hypothesizes that the hemodynamic status of the heart and the brain is an important but underestimated cause of VCI. We investigate this by studying to what extent hemodynamic changes contribute to VCI and what the mechanisms involved are. Here, we provide an overview of the design and protocol. Methods: The Heart-Brain Study is a multicenter cohort study with a follow-up measurement after 2 years among 645 participants (175 VCI, 175 COD, 175 HF, and 120 controls). Enrollment criteria are the following: 1 of the 3 diseases diagnosed according to current guidelines, age ≥50 years, no magnetic resonance contraindications, ability to undergo cognitive testing, and independence in daily life. A core clinical dataset is collected including sociodemographic factors, cardiovascular risk factors, detailed neurologic, cardiac, and medical history, medication, and a physical examination. In addition, we perform standardized neuropsychological testing, cardiac, vascular and brain MRI, and blood sampling. In subsets of participants we assess Alz­heimer biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid, and assess echocardiography and 24-hour blood pressure monitoring. Follow-up measurements after 2 years include neuropsychological testing, brain MRI, and blood samples for all participants. We use centralized state-of-the-art storage platforms for clinical and imaging data. Imaging data are processed centrally with automated standardized pipelines. Results and Conclusions: The Heart-Brain Study investigates relationships between (cardio-)vascular factors, the hemodynamic status of the heart and the brain, and cognitive impairment. By studying the complete heart-brain axis in patient groups that represent components of this axis, we have the opportunity to assess a combination of clinical and subclinical manifestations of disorders of the heart, vascular system and brain, with hemodynamic status as a possible binding factor. © 2017 The Author(s).

Certain schemes of work may be more successful at fostering creativity and that relying purely on the National Curriculum can hinder opportunities for creativity. Teacher responses indicate that they value creativity but find it hard to accurately describe incidents of creativity being fostered and teaching creatively is often confused for teaching for creativity.

In many ways, given their respective pursuits of scientific enquiry and learning, valuable contribution to a knowledge economy, commitment to public enlightenment, and exploration of critical and creative endeavour, a relationship between the sectors makes sense. Unity notwithstanding, the relationships have become increasingly now influenced by (en)forced contextual constraints (e.g. government policy development and intervention, neoliberal market forces, structural and ideological shifts in funding acquisition and allocation, patronage changes and demands, and/or individual political priorities). Drawing on education and heritage scholarship, and theoretical frameworks of sport culture spaces, this paper examines efforts undertaken at one specific Higher Education establishment in the United Kingdom in which institutional agendas (vis-à-vis historical and cultural foci, encouraging ‘impactful’ academic activity, brand exposure, economic efficiency, and community engagement) have contoured, and become entwined with, an embryonic sport heritage and archive project. Recalling similar arrangements elsewhere, the aim of this case study is to explore how the wider education and cultural policy context have precipitated an increasingly symbiotic and dependent relationship between university and cultural/arts initiatives. The paper considers how the impetus to develop a sports-based (basketball) heritage archive and study centre reflects the current fragilities of the two sectors, yet, concomitantly, reveals the potentials that might be developed from fostering greater intellectual and pragmatic alliances. The paper concludes by advocating the practical, political and ideological usefulness of network formation, sustainability measures and continued cross-sector dialogue. © 2017 Geoffery Z. Kohe.

Critical study of Porter’s personal photographic archive and unpublished primary sources shows that this paradigmatic vision requires substantial modification. Lucy Wallace Porter (1876-1962), who became the medievalist’s wife in 1912, was the chief photographer of the two from 1919 onwards. She made significant contributions to her husband’s scholarship, alone producing more than two-thirds of the photographs published in Romanesque Sculpture of the Pilgrimage Roads, which amounted to over 1500 prints. Our picture of Porter the scholar becomes very different if we realize that he often saw Romanesque sculpture through the eyes of his photographer wife. Moreover, all subsequent users of Porter’s landmark publications have perceived Romanesque sculpture through her eyes as well. In addition to examining the holdings, history, and use of Porter’s picture library, this article analyzes previously unpublished photographs that afford new vistas onto the couple’s lives, imaginations, and camera work. It also explores the fascinating story of Lucy Porter’s eye-and mind-training, proposing that she deserves recognition as one of the most influential women photographers in the field of art history during the twentieth century. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Art Historiography; Arthur Kingsley Porter (1883-1933); Lucy Wallace Porter (1876-1962); Medieval Art; Photography; Romanesque Sculpture; Women Photographers",,2-s2.0-85024500219

This paper argues that oral history is a highly distinctive example of historical narrative-making, created by ‘ordinary’ people and contextualised by the professional historian, providing us with a fascinating alternative to constructing and imagining ‘histories’ beyond more conventionally understood ‘texts’. Specifically, I endorse the value of deconstructing and analysing subjectivities that determine narrative construction in and of oral history (This article is drawn from a BA dissertation entitled, ‘History is the work of a thousand different hands’: a study of the value of oral history, incorporating a case study of the socio-cultural histories of men and women’s home front experiences in West Sussex 1939–1945, submitted in May 2015.

Critiques of the concept of style are now well established and this formerly dominant method of approaching the analysis of art historical objects has largely fallen out of favour in current scholarship. Beyond rehearsing these familiar critical points, it will be argued that a consideration of the limitations of this foundational disciplinary concept may be a paradoxically productive exercise if an approach is taken that examines the boundaries, or limits, to the kinds of objects and images to which the concept of style has been applied. It will be argued that a number of historically liminal categories of person-children, primitives, the mentally ill and criminals-inform the genealogy of perception of the contemporary liminal “styles” of graffiti, post-graffiti and street art; and that these limit cases, rather than being marginalized exclusions not worthy of analytic attention, are generative of the very coherence of the notion of style. Following Ranciere [Aisthesis: Scenes from the Aesthetic Regime of Art, London, 2013], it is argued that contemporary applications of the concept of style may lie in attending to the contingency and primacy of the processes of perception itself, an essential component of seminal approaches to style (e.g., Wolfflin, Principies of Art History.

Trying to answer this question, in this paper we propose a method to link three different approaches that share the same stratigraphic principle: the excavation of the cave's floor sediments, the confection of a Harris' matrix of the painting process of one of the panels with rock art; and the study and further chemical analysis (SEM-EDS and Raman) of micro samples taken from the figures painted and the rock underlying. The potential of every single approach is multiplied by the interconnection given by the discovery of small layers of carbonization in the cave's walls as a result of several combustion events (hearths) done inside the cave. It must be highlighted, that this crucial information was obtained by using a novel methodology previously developed by the group of authors (Tascon et al., 2016). It allowed us to identify and chemically characterize superficial as well as underlying soot layers. Besides, the combination of this piece of information with other archeological evidences was vital to obtain a holistic view of the historical process developed at the caves of Oyola's archeological site, in the Argentinean northwest. Despite this is a case of study, the potentialities of this methodology can be spread out into other shelters with similar characteristics. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Archaeology; History; Raman spectroscopy; Rock art; Stratigraphy",,2-s2.0-85023642068

The extension of the density-dependent term to a finite range is discussed and has led to the D2 Gogny force. A global refitting of the force has been done but preserving standard good properties of the Gogny force. Indeed the same fitting procedure with the same constraints and filters which have been used to obtain the D1-type parametrizations has been applied. The evolution of global properties (binding energies and nuclear radii) along the N = 8, 20, 28, 40 isotopic chains is discussed at the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation level. Results coming from systematic calculations based on 1385 nuclei are also presented. Axial symmetry has been assumed. A comparison with the results obtained using the D1S parametrization, which tends to show that the D2 and the D1S Gogny force display very similar axial deformation properties, is done. © 2017, SIF, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",,,2-s2.0-85030858403

Our observations demonstrate that the bones and joints of the thoracic cage, pectoral girdle, the extremities, particularly the upper limb, the skull and the pelvis were distinctly shown in the sculp-tures. Muscles of the neck (sternocleidomastoid, trapezius), shoulder (deltoid), thoracic cage (pectoralis major), limbs (arm and forearm), and anterior abdominal wall were clearly carved into the sculptures. The trachea was correctly placed in the neck. The boundaries of the axilla, and trian-gles of the neck were also clearly seen. Our observations demonstrate that ancient Indi-an artists of the Gandhara region had a basic knowledge of human anatomy, especially surface anatomy and musculoskeletal features. They also possessed knowledge of the approximate size and position of the bones, joints and muscles, including their approximate origin and insertion points. How-ever, certain errors of anatomical knowledge in- cluding an extra number of ribs and a segmented sternum were noticed. Further, they also seemed to have some basic ideas about the physiological changes that occur during starving, as it is evident in the Buddha sculptures, which are skinny and emaciated.","Ancient India; Fasting Buddha; Gandhara art; History of anatomy; Sculptures","abdominal wall; anatomy; art; axilla; deltoid muscle; diet restriction; error; forearm; human; India; information center; pelvis; photography; rib cage; skull; sternocleidomastoid muscle; sternum; trachea; trapezius muscle",2-s2.0-85032798313

A total of 263 sport-poomsae competitors (112 females; 151 males; aged between 12-44 years), who competed at the 2014 sport poomsae taekwondo competition, participated in this study. The prevalence rate of COP and possible risk factors associated with COP were analyzed by using Chi-square tests and independent t-tests.RESULTS: A total of 173 athletes reported that they experienced COP (65.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 60.5-71.5). Female athletes showed a higher prevalence rate than their male counterparts (75.9% vs. 58.3%). Lower body (61.5%) and knee joints (26.4%) were the two primarily injured body part. A total of 101 athletes reported that they injured in the previous year. Among those, 81.2% were suffered from COP. The technique that caused pain most frequently was side-kick among females and front-kick among males. Prevalence rates of COP were significantly different by sex, education level, training hour, and a history of injury.CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of COP is high among sport poomsae taekwondo athletes. Competitors who are female, have a history of injury, and train for extended hours were more likely to experience COP. To identify other potential risk factors of COP in sport poomsae taekwondo, more research is needed to build upon the findings. © 2017 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.","Cumulative trauma disorders; Martial arts; Prevalence",,2-s2.0-85028695565

This study examined ART treatment adherence and adherence self-efficacy among people living with HIV with a history of drug use in Vietnam. We used cross-sectional baseline data collected between October 2014 and February 2015 from a randomized controlled trial in Vietnam. Of the 900 persons with a history of drug use in the trial, a sample of 109 people living with HIV currently on ART were included in the study. The vast majority (92%) of the participants reported not missing any medications in the past 30 days. Multiple regression results indicated that social support was positively associated with adherence self-efficacy (β = 0.420, P < 0.001) and general adherence to ART (β = 0.201, P = 0.0368). General adherence to ART was negatively associated with depressive symptoms (β = −0.188, P = 0.046) and current heroin use (β = −0.196, P = 0.042). These findings underscore the importance of addressing mental health and social challenges facing people living with HIV with a history of drug use to promote ART treatment adherence.

The purpose of this essay is to ask why Benjamin would have considered print to be different or less historically consequential compared to photography and cinema when the revolutionary potential he ascribes to these more recent technologies is also prefigured in his other writings on books and literature. Answering this question helps to create a sharper picture of what matters to Benjamin about new media and also points to figures like Georg Lukács who influenced Benjamin's account of technology and art.

Bill focused on the processes responsible for radiation-induced genomic instability, and while ionizing radiation was known to induce this phenomenon, the precise causes were poorly understood. Here we revisit Bill's unique approach to these problems, as he advocated the use of novel mammalian cell lines to tease apart the mechanisms responsible for destabilizing an otherwise stable nuclear genome.CONCLUSIONS: Genomic instability is a multifaceted process posited to be the driving force behind multistep carcinogenesis. Bill used a variety of innovative techniques that ultimately refined our understanding of the causes and consequences of radiation-induced chromosomal instability and the role it played in cancer predisposition. The central concepts of genomic instability fit nicely with the mutator phenotype hypothesis proposed by Lawrence Loeb, both of which represent functionally similar frameworks for describing how genomic stability can be compromised. The field of genomic instability has since advanced considerably, and much of our current knowledge is due to the efforts of Bill Morgan.","chromosomal instability; Genomic instability; ionizing radiation","animal; art; genomic instability; history; human; metabolism; mitochondrion; oxidative stress; radiation response; radiobiology; Animals; Genomic Instability; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Mitochondria; Oxidative Stress; Radiobiology",2-s2.0-85030976866

However, an alternative interpretation suggests that offspring may reproduce earlier in the presence of half- or step-siblings as the indirect fitness benefits to investing in them are lower, relative to delaying reproduction and investing in full siblings. From this perspective, father absence may perform no causal role in facilitating the onset of menarche. Using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, I find that individuals with only half- or step-siblings reach reproductive age earlier than those with only full siblings, with no independent effect of father absence. These results suggest that inclusive fitness benefits to investing in siblings, rather than father absence, may predict variation in age at menarche. These results provide a greater understanding of the adaptive mechanisms involved in reproductive decision-making, as well as potential implications for human life-history evolution and cooperative breeding more broadly. © 2017 The Authors.","ALSPAC; Father absence; Inclusive fitness; Life history; Menarche; Siblings",,2-s2.0-85031504073

SUMMARY ANSWER Career-focused women place more importance on pregnancy planning, have greater confidence in delayed childbearing, and are more ethically accepting of donor gamete ART than women who do not place as much importance on career success. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Women in high-professional careers are more likely to delay childbearing while simultaneously possessing a stronger desire for motherhood. The underlying values which enable these competing desires have not been elucidated. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION This cross-sectional study utilized data from the National Survey of Fertility Barriers (NSFB), a nationally representative telephone survey of US women aged 25-45. Funded by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the NSFB surveyed 4712 women from 2004 to 2007. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS In addition to demographic data, the NSFB obtained information about the reproductive history and personal values of participants. Weighted multivariate regression analysis was used to assess reproductive values in career-focused women. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE In total, 48.8% of women considered success in work very important, while 17.3% considered it somewhat or not important. Women who placed less value on career success were less likely to consider pregnancy planning important and were less optimistic about the success of delayed childbearing than their work-centric counterparts. Women less focused on their careers were also more likely to have serious ethical concerns about donor gametes, but less likely to have ethical concerns about IUI or IVF, when compared to career-focused women. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION Intention to bear children could not be evaluated in the setting of career intentions due to a lack of data on when the participant intended on pursuing motherhood. Political preferences on reproductive health were also not evaluated. The validity of the career priority questions has not been assessed. Additionally, respondents' value statements were not matched to subsequent actions, so it remains possible that these values do not directly impact reproductive behaviors. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS Our results suggest that reproductive counseling for career-focused women should focus on effective contraception when attempting to delay pregnancy, improved knowledge about age-related fertility decline, and the scope and limitations of current reproductive technologies. In addition, the unique reproductive views of career-focused women suggest that they may benefit from increased employer/insurer support for strategies to enable delayed childbearing, such as fertility preservation and third-party reproduction. © 2017 The Author.","ART; career choice; delayed childbearing; family planning; IVF; medical ethics","adult; child; contraception; controlled study; counseling; cross-sectional study; decision making; demography; employer; family planning; female; fertility preservation; gamete; human; human cell; major clinical study; medical ethics; mother; national health organization; personal value; pregnancy; regression analysis; reproductive behavior; reproductive health; reproductive history; study design; telephone interview; validity",2-s2.0-85030683575

Differences between sexes in age, cardiovascular risk factors and revascularization therapy have been proposed as possible reasons. Objective: To select sets of female and male patients comparable in respect of relevant risk factors in order to compare the sex-specific risk in a systematic manner. Methods: Data of the ISAR-RISK and ART studies were investigated. Patients were enrolled between 1996 and 2005 and suffered from AMI within 4 weeks prior to enrolment. Patients of each sex were selected with 1:1 equivalent age, previous AMI history, sinus-rhythm presence, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking status, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and revascularization therapy. Survival times were compared between sex groups in the whole study cohort and in the matched cohort. Results: Of 3840 consecutive AMI survivors, 994 (25.9%) were females and 2846 (74.1%) were males. Females were older and suffered more frequently from hypertension and diabetes mellitus. In the whole cohort, females showed an increased mortality with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.54 compared to males (p<0.0001). The matched cohort comprised 802 patients of each sex and revealed a trend towards poorer survival in females (HR for female sex 1.14; p = 0.359). However, significant mortality differences with a higher risk in matched females was observed during the first year after AMI (HR = 1.61; p = 0.045) but not during the subsequent years. Conclusion: Matched sub-groups of post-AMI patients showed a comparable long-term mortality. However, a female excess mortality remained during first year after AMI and cannot be explained by differences in age, cardiovascular risk factors, and modes of acute treatment. Other causal factors, including clinical as well as psychological and social aspects, need to be considered. Female post-AMI patients should be followed more actively particularly during the first year after AMI. © 2017 Ubrich et al.

The author’s approach to child psychotherapy, based on contemporary psychoanalytic theories, allows the therapist to play any parental role that helps to repair developmental deficiencies and conflicts. These include nurturing, supporting, mirroring, role modeling, challenging, and limit setting. Following Winnicott, psychotherapy is conceived as a play space in which therapist and child are both spontaneous. The value of interpretation and insight in child therapy is discussed. There follows a more detailed discussion of three major problem areas in child psychotherapy: handling anger and hostile aggression; handling issues related to sexuality; and handling narcissistic issues of inferiority and shame. © 2017 N.P.A.P.",,"anger; case report; child; child parent relation; child psychiatry; female; human; male; psychoanalytic theory; sexuality; shame; theoretical study",2-s2.0-85031291855

The main objective of this paper is to cover this research gap through a bibliometric analysis, that covers 95 years (1918–2013), of articles published in peer-reviewed journals extracted from the SCOPUS database. Bibliometric indicators and laws have been applied to better understand the patterns that govern the scientific literature on this realm. A gender perspective has also been implemented in the analysis. The analysis provides quantitative results based on 321 articles published by 478 authors in 210 scientific journals. The data showed the high dispersion of the literature, both in terms of authors and journals focused on the topic, and a low level of collaboration among both authors and institutions. Regarding the research topic, half of the papers were related to the impact of conflict on civilians and civil society. The implementation of a gender perspective shows that most of the first, second and third authors of the papers are women. In terms of methodologies, qualitative methodologies are the most relevant and women are more prolific applying these methodology. In terms of geographical region of the research, most of the studies have been performed by authors from institutions in Anglo-Saxon countries, and most of the fieldwork has been focused on the United States and the main areas of conflict in the world throughout history.

Accordingly, detecting pedestrians from raw sensor data has a history of more than 15 years of research, with vision playing a central role. During the last years, deep learning has boosted the accuracy of image-based pedestrian detectors. However, detection is just the first step towards answering the core question, namely is the vehicle going to crash with a pedestrian provided preventive actions are not taken? Therefore, knowing as soon as possible if a detected pedestrian has the intention of crossing the road ahead of the vehicle is essential for performing safe and comfortable maneuvers that prevent a crash. However, compared to pedestrian detection, there is relatively little literature on detecting pedestrian intentions. This paper aims to contribute along this line by presenting a new vision-based approach which analyzes the pose of a pedestrian along several frames to determine if he or she is going to enter the road or not. We present experiments showing 750 ms of anticipation for pedestrians crossing the road, which at a typical urban driving speed of 50 km/h can provide 15 additional meters (compared to a pure pedestrian detector) for vehicle automatic reactions or to warn the driver. Moreover, in contrast with state-of-the-art methods, our approach is monocular, neither requiring stereo nor optical flow information. © 2017 by the authors.

Although hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma syndrome is defined by fumarate hydratase (FH) germline mutations, resulting in S-(2-succino)-cysteine (2SC) formation, it is unknown whether leiomyomas with bizarre nuclei show similar alterations. In this study, we evaluated the morphology and FH/2SC immunoprofile of 31 leiomyomas with bizarre nuclei. DNA from tumor and normal tissues from 24 cases was subjected to massively parallel sequencing targeting 410 key cancer genes. Somatic genetic alterations were detected using state-of-the-art bioinformatics algorithms. No patient reported a personal history of renal neoplasia or cutaneous leiomyomas, but one had a family history of renal cell carcinoma while another had a family history of uterine leiomyomas. Aberrant FH/2SC expression was noted in 17 tumors (16 FH-negative/2SC-positive, 1 FH-positive/2SC-positive). On univariate analysis, staghorn vessels, eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions, diffuse distribution of prominent eosinophilic nucleoli with perinucleolar halos, and an 'alveolar pattern of edema' were associated with an abnormal immunoprofile, but only staghorn vessels remained significant on multivariate analysis. Massively parallel sequencing analysis (n=24) revealed that 13/14 tumors with aberrant FH/2SC immunoprofile harbored somatic FH somatic genetic alterations, including homozygous deletions (n=9), missense mutations coupled with loss of heterozygosity (n=3), and a splice site mutation (n=1), whereas no somatic FH mutations/deletions were found in tumors with normal immunoprofile (n=10; P<0.0001). Leiomyomas with bizarre nuclei with normal FH/2SC staining pattern more frequently harbored TP53 and/or RB1 alterations than those with aberrant FH/2SC immunoprofile (60 vs 14%; P=0.032). These data demonstrate that leiomyomas with bizarre nuclei are morphologically and genetically heterogeneous and that hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma syndrome-related morphological features, abnormal FH/2SC staining, and somatic FH mutations/deletions can be seen in a subset of sporadic tumors. © 2017 USCAP, Inc All rights reserved.",,"fumarate hydratase; adult; aged; algorithm; Article; cancer surgery; cell inclusion; clinical article; controlled study; family history; female; germline mutation; heterozygosity loss; human; hysterectomy; immunohistochemistry; indel mutation; missense mutation; myomectomy; priority journal; protein expression; renal cell carcinoma; somatic mutation; tumor gene; univariate analysis; uterus myoma",2-s2.0-85030627676

Effective geometric restoration of these distorted document images considerably increases character recognition rate in large-scale digitisation. For large-scale digitisation of historical books, geometric restoration solutions expect to be accurate, generic, robust, unsupervised and reversible. However, most methods in the literature concentrate on improving restoration accuracy for specific distortion effect, but not their applicability in large-scale digitisation. This study proposes an effective mesh based geometric restoration system (GRLSD) for large-scale distorted historical document digitisation. In this system, an automatic mesh generation based dewarping tool is proposed to geometrically model and correct arbitrary warping historical documents. An XML-based mesh recorder is proposed to record the mesh of distortion information for reversible use. A graphic user interface (GUI) toolkit is designed to visually display and manually manipulate the mesh for improving geometric restoration accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed automatic dewarping approach efficiently corrects arbitrarily warped historical documents, with an improved performance over several state-of-the-art geometric restoration methods. By using XML mesh recorder and GUI toolkit, the GRLSD system greatly aids users to flexibly monitor and correct ambiguous points of mesh for the prevention of damaging historical document images without distortions in large-scale digitalisation. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,"Character recognition; Geometry; Graphical user interfaces; History; Restoration; User interfaces; XML; Automatic mesh generation; Distortion effects; Geometric distortion; Graphic user interface (GUI); Historical documents; Restoration methods; Scanned document images; Storage condition; Mesh generation",2-s2.0-85031699507

Preoperative anesthetic assessment in the ambulatory setting has become important because patients with numerous complex comorbidities are now commonplace in this arena. Disease states involving the lungs, the heart, the kidneys, and subpopulations including those who are obese and the elderly commonly receive anesthetics in an ambulatory setting. Recent Findings: This review presents key aspects of current thinking with regard to preoperative assessment and considerations for different critical disease states and subpopulations that are now being managed under ambulatory surgery. Same day surgery centers require patient safety, and expectations are high for patient satisfaction. Advancements in surgical and anesthetic technique have allowed for more complex patients to partake in ambulatory surgery.

Particular attention is paid to the geographies of patronage networks, the mobility of artists, the plurality of roles played by intermediaries and the relations between patrons and artists. These themes then structure the analysis of crowd-patronage through a case study of the patronage platform Patreon in the remainder of the paper.

This increased incidence is concerning to the health care system. This study aims to determine the fre­quency of multiple pregnancy and identify factors that affect this frequency in Tehran, Iran. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study included 5170 mothers in labor be­tween July 6-21, 2015 from 103 hospitals with Obstetrics and Gynecology Wards. The questionnaire used in this study consisted of five parts: demographic characteristics: in­formation related to pregnancy; information related to the infant: information regarding the multiple pregnancy; and information associated with infertility. We recruited 103 trained midwives to collect data related to the questionnaire from eligible participants through an interview and medical records review. Frequencies and odds ratios (OR) for the association between multiple pregnancy and the selected characteristics (maternal age. economic status, history of multiple pregnancy in first-degree relatives, and repro­ductive history) were computed by multiple logistic regression. Stata software, version 13 (Stata Corp. College Station. TX. USA) was used for all statistical analyses. Results: Multiple pregnancy had a prevalence of 1.48% [95% confidence interval (Cl): 1.19-1.85], After controlling for confounding variables, we observed a significant as­sociation between frequency of multiple pregnancy and mother’s age (OR=1.04, 95% Cl: 1.001-1.09.

Retinal cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a common opportunistic infection and remains a significant contributor to visual loss in patients with AIDS. We highlight the poor outcomes of CMV retinitis in three HIV-infected patients who were initiated on antiretroviral therapy (ART). We conducted a retrospective chart review of advanced stage HIV-infected patients with known CMV retinitis. Case 1. A 37-year-old man, with a CD4+ cell count of 35 cells/µL, presented for ART initiation with a 5-month history of visual loss in his left eye. Fundoscopy showed left eye CMV retinitis and right eye HIV retinopathy. ART and 5 months of weekly intravitreal ganciclovir injections (left eye) were commenced. Six-month outcomes included virological suppression, and visual acuity in the right eye of 6/6 and in the left eye of 3/60. Case 2. A 31-year-old woman, with a CD4+ cell count of 39 cells/µL and on tuberculosis therapy, presented for ART initiation. She presented with a 2-month history of decreased visual acuity. Fundoscopy showed bilateral CMV retinitis, which was more pronounced in the left eye. ART and 8 months of intravitreal ganciclovir injections were commenced. Six-month outcomes included virological suppression and visual acuity in the right eye of 6/9, and in the left eye of 6/24. Case 3. A 29-year-old woman, with a CD4+ cell count of 24 cells/µL, who was on tuberculosis therapy and ART, complained of blurred vision at her 2-month ART follow-up visit. Fundoscopy showed bilateral retinal detachment secondary to CMV retinitis. While silicone oil tamponade and subsequent retinectomy successfully repaired the right eye, extensive damage rendered the left eye irreparable. Six-month outcomes included virological suppression, with 6/120 visual acuity in the right eye and complete blindness in the left eye. Conclusion. CMV retinitis causes debilitating, permanent sequelae, which is preventable by ART initiation at higher CD4+ cell counts. Despite achieving virological suppression, vision could not be completely restored in these patients, irrespective of the severity of CMV retinitis. © 2017, South African Medical Association.

We describe outcomes of patients commenced on ART at Newlands Clinic between 2004 and 2006 after ≥10 years of comprehensive care including, psychosocial, adherence and food support. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, patient data from an electronic medical record collected during routine care were analysed. We describe baseline characteristics, virological and clinical outcomes, attrition rates, and treatment adverse effects until November 2016. We defined virological suppression as viral load <50 copies/ml and virological failure as >1000 copies/ml after ≥6 months of ART. Results: We analysed data for 605 patients (67% female) who commenced ART, and were followed-up for 5819 person-years (median: 10.7 years, IQR: 10.1–11.4). Median age at ART initiation was 34 years (IQR: 17–42). Pre-ART, 129 (21.3%) patients had history of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). In care, 66 (11%) developed PTB, and 24 (4%) developed extrapulmonary tuberculosis. 385 (63.6%) patients experienced ≥1 adverse event, the most frequent being stavudine-induced peripheral neuropathy (n = 252, 41.7%). At database closure on 14 November 2016, 474 (78.3%) patients were still in care, 428 (90.3%) being virologically suppressed, and 21 (4.4%) failing. While 483 (79.8%) remained on first line, 122 (20.2%) were switched to second line ART. Fifty-nine patients (9.8%) were transferred to other ART facilities, 45 (7.4%) were lost to follow-up, 25 (4.1%) died, and two stopped ART.

It is moreover very useful for biostratigraphic correlation and has a long research history. The species occurs in huge numbers, and in all developmental stages, in rocks belonging to the Alum Shale Formation in Sweden. Here it can be found in both shale and limestone (‘Orsten’) nodules, sometimes excellently preserved. In this study, we present a review of the species, including an account of its research history, spatio-temporal distribution, biostratigraphic utility, anatomy, ontogeny, and inferred mode of life, together with the characteristics of its host rock. Furthermore, herein science meets art to describe the process of how we successfully were able to ‘breathe life’ into this important fossil species by constructing greatly enlarged and highly detailed three-dimensional sculptural models. Three different versions were produced, including one with the test completely enrolled (i.e., animal in inferred protective mode), one with test slightly gaping (i.e., animal in active ‘swimming’ mode) and a ‘fake SEM’ version (i.e., showing how the actual miniscule fossils are perceived when studied in a scanning electron microscope). Replicas such as these fulfil very important purposes as they can be used for research as well as teaching and outreach, allowing scientists and laymen alike to study minute, extinct organisms first-hand and up close. One of the ultimate and also long-term goals of these A. pisiformis sculptures is to include them into a traveling exhibition on life in the Cambrian seas. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Agnostus pisiformis; Cambrian; Exceptional preservation; Phosphatization; Reconstructions; ‘Orsten’","biostratigraphy; Cambrian; fossil; host rock; paleontology; phosphatization; preservation; reconstruction; trilobite; Sweden; Agnostus pisiformis; Animalia; Arthropoda; Pisum sativum",2-s2.0-85030458094

The natural history of pNENs is highly variable. 90% of all insulinomas or small NF- pNENs are readily curable by surgical resection. Most other functional and late detected NF-pNENs have a less favorable chance for cure. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed to identify the current state of the art with regard to the key issues of surgery in pNEN G1/G2. Results: This article provides a comprehensive review of the current literature addressing the current challenges in pNEN surgery.

Over that time period, computational power and simulation capabilities have increased substantially and now allow for new multiphysics modeling possibilities that were not practical or feasible for most of TREAT's operational history. Hence the return of TREAT to operational service provides a unique opportunity to apply state-of-the-art software and associated methods in the modeling and simulation of general three-dimensional steady state and kinetic behavior for reactor operation, and for coupling of the core power transient model to experiment simulations. However, measurements taken in previous operations were intended to predict power deposition in experimental samples, with little consideration of three-dimensional core power distributions. Hence, interpretation of data for the purpose of validation of modern methods can be challenging. For the research discussed herein, efforts are described for the process of proper interpretation of data from the most recent calibration experiments performed in the core, the M8 calibration series (M8-CAL). These measurements were taken between 1990 and 1993 using a set of fission wires and test fuel pins to estimate the power deposition that would be produced in fast reactor test fuel pins during the M8 experiment series. Because of the decision to place TREAT into a standby state in 1994, the M8 series of transients were never performed. However, potentially valuable information relevant for validation is available in the M8-CAL measurement data, if properly interpreted. This paper describes the current state of the process of recovery of useful data from M8-CAL measurements and quantification of biases and uncertainties to potentially apply to the validation of multiphysics methods. Our findings provide us with confidence in our methods; however, confidence and validation are not the same thing, and it is difficult to identify the data here as being useful in validation of computational methods. We conclude that in future work validation calculations must be performed in a manner similar to the actual measurements, by performing simulation of detector responses for the calibration series. © 2017","Calibration; Instrumentation; M8-CAL; Modeling; TREAT; Uncertainty","Calibration; Computer software; Deposition; Fast reactors; Models; Test facilities; Transient analysis; Calibration experiments; Core power distribution; Idaho national laboratories; Instrumentation; M8-CAL; Multi-physics modeling; TREAT; Uncertainty; Uncertainty analysis",2-s2.0-85026205686

Indications for cesarean delivery included elective repeat ce- sarean, breech presentation, and failure to progress. Patients with the following conditions were excluded from ECD: need for concomitant intraabdominal procedures, emergency cesarean, placenta previa, fetal macro-somia, and &lt;34 weeks of gestation. RESULTS: ECDs were mostly performed by 4th and 2nd year residents with one attending obstetrician scrubbed in for the key steps. Fifteen out of 20 patients had a history of cesarean delivery. Gestational ages were from 360/7 to 420/7 weeks. Birth weights ranged from 2,470 to 4,260 g (3,360.95±462.88). Quantitative blood loss ranged from 200 to 1,050 mL (661.2±253.5). Total operative times were from 40 to 81 minutes (54.5± 12.68). Incidental peritoneal fenestrations occurred in 8 cases (40%). Vacuum extraction was used in 12 cases (60%).

With the proliferation of GPS and tracking technologies, huge volumes of trajectories are rapidly generated and collected. Under this, applications such as route recommendation and traveling behavior mining call for efficient trajectory retrieval. In this paper, we first focus on distance-to-points trajectory search; given a collection of trajectories and a set query points, the goal is to retrieve the top-k trajectories that pass as close as possible to all query points. We advance the state-of-the-art by combining existing approaches to a hybrid nearest neighbor-based method while also proposing an alternative, more efficient spatial range-based approach. Second, we investigate the continuous counterpart of distance-to-points trajectory search where the query is long-standing and the set of returned trajectories needs to be maintained whenever updates occur to the query and/or the data. Third, we propose and study two practical variants of distance-to-points trajectory search, which take into account the temporal characteristics of the searched trajectories. Through an extensive experimental analysis with real trajectory data, we show that our range-based approach outperforms previous methods by at least one order of magnitude for the snapshot and up to several times for the continuous version of the queries. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Continuous queries; Spatial proximity; Trajectory search","Information systems; Planning; Continuous queries; Experimental analysis; Nearest neighbors; Real trajectories; Spatial proximity; Temporal characteristics; Tracking technology; Trajectory searches; Trajectories; GPS; spatial data; tracking; trajectory",2-s2.0-84982313543

By performing a joint statistical analysis of both probes, we test the standard Λcold dark matter model, confirming a mild tension between cosmic microwave background predictions from Planck mission and cosmic growth measurements at low redshift (z &lt; 2).

To that end, first, translational motion is modeled as a polynomial signal, and inspired by the fact that all the scatterers in the moving target experience the same translational range history, the phase difference operation and keystone transform (KT) are utilized to transform the energy of all the scatterers into one range cell. Second, by the virtue of the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT), the energy of all the scatterers is coherently accumulated into a peak point, and from which the polynomial coefficients can be obtained accurately. With the estimated polynomial coefficients, the dechirp operation and KT are applied jointly to compensate range misalignment and phase error. The analysis of the proposed method shows that it is of low computational complexity due to avoiding multidimensional search and improves the output SNR providing satisfactory low SNR performance.

This paper presents a detailed review and case study of the current state-of-the art LMM direct methods applied to the structural integrity assessment. The focus is on the development and use of the linear matching method framework (LMMF) on a wide range of crucial aspects for the power industry. The LMMF is reviewed to show a wide range of capabilities of the direct methods under this framework, and the basic theory background is also presented. Different structural integrity aspects are covered including the calculation of shakedown, ratchet, and creep rupture limits. Furthermore, the crack initiation assessments of an un-cracked body by the LMM are shown for cases both with and without the presence of a creep dwell during the cyclic loading history. Finally, an overview of the in house developed LMM plug-in is given, presenting the intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) developed. The efficiency and robustness of these direct methods in calculating the aforementioned quantities are confirmed through a numerical case study, which is a semicircular notched (Bridgman notch) bar. A two-dimensional axisymmetric finite element model is adopted, and the notched bar is subjected to both cyclic and constant axial mechanical loads. For the crack initiation assessment, different cyclic loading conditions are evaluated to demonstrate the impact of the different load types on the structural response. The impact of creep dwell is also investigated to show how this parameter is capable of causing in some cases a dangerous phenomenon known as creep ratcheting. All the results in the case study demonstrate the level of simplicity of the LMMs but at the same time accuracy, efficiency, and robustness over the more complicated and inefficient incremental finite element analyses. © Copyright 2017 by ASME.","cyclic enhanced creep; cyclic plasticity; linear matching method (LMM); notched bar; structural integrity","Crack initiation; Cracks; Creep; Cyclic loads; Efficiency; Graphical user interfaces; Numerical methods; Structural integrity; Axisymmetric finite elements; Cyclic loading conditions; Cyclic plasticity; Graphical user interfaces (GUI); Incremental finite element analysis; Linear matching methods; Notched bar; Structural integrity assessment; Finite element method",2-s2.0-85021713597

Both riding and contributing to the successive waves of technology, my laboratory has elucidated fundamental mechanisms in DNA replication, repair, and recombination. We have made substantial contributions in the area of retroviral oncogenesis, delineated mechanisms that control retroviral gene expression, and elucidated critical details of the structure and function of the retroviral enzymes--reverse transcriptase, protease, and integrase--and have had the satisfaction of knowing that the fundamental knowledge gained from these studies contributed important groundwork for the eventual development of antiviral drugs to treat AIDS.

In contrast to existing deep learning based trackers that use binary classification for region candidates, we use regression for direct prediction of the tracking locations both at the convolutional layer and at the recurrent unit. Our experimental results on challenging benchmark video tracking datasets show that our tracker is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining low computational cost. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Convolution; Deep neural networks; Image recognition; Long short-term memory; Neural networks; Object detection; Object recognition; Regression analysis; Tracking (position); Binary classification; Computational costs; Convolutional networks; Convolutional neural network; Region information; State-of-the-art approach; Tracking locations; Visual object tracking; Recurrent neural networks",2-s2.0-85032682284

Reionization impulsively heats the intergalactic medium (IGM) to , and owing to long cooling and dynamical times in the diffuse gas that are comparable to the Hubble time, memory of reionization heating is retained. Therefore, a late-ending reionization has significant implications for the structure of the Lyμ forest. Using state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations that allow us to vary the timing of reionization and its associated heat injection, we argue that extant thermal signatures from reionization can be detected via the Lyμ forest power spectrum at . This arises because the small-scale cutoff in the power depends not only the the IGM temperature at these epochs, but is also particularly sensitive to the pressure-smoothing scale set by the IGM full thermal history. Comparing our different reionization models with existing measurements of the Lyμ forest flux power spectrum at , we find that models satisfying Planck's constraint favor a moderate amount of heat injection consistent with galaxies driving reionization, but disfavoring quasar-driven scenarios. We study the feasibility of measuring the flux power spectrum at using mock quasar spectra and conclude that a sample of ∼10 high-resolution spectra with an attainable signal-to-noise ratio will allow distinguishing between different reionization scenarios. © 2017.

There is growing consensus among the respiratory community that although patient histories and lung function testing are the minimum required for clinical examinations, these tests alone are not sufficient for disease characterization. Therefore, the use of computed tomography (CT) imaging is increasing used in clinical decision making for lung diseases. Lung diseases affect various components of lung, including the small airways, lung parenchyma, the interstitial space and the pulmonary vasculature. Quantitative CT (QCT) methods are emerging and are increasingly available using commercial software to quantify the underlying disease components, and a growing body of evidence suggests that QCT is an important tool in the clinical setting to help accurately and reproducibly detect where the disease is located in the lung, and to quantify the extent and overall severity for several lung diseases. Furthermore, this growing body of evidence has promoted the use of thoracic QCT to the point that it is now considered by many as an indispensable technology for longitudinal analysis and intervention trials.

This follows from the fact that engines are required to operate under increasingly harsh conditions in all kind of gas turbine applications following the demands for higher efficiency and operational flexibility. While the understanding of the mechanism of CMAS induced degradation of TBCs as well as approaches for mitigation of CMAS attack by means of advanced TBC compositions have grown remarkably, most of the reported results have been obtained from lab testing at isothermal conditions or from evaluation of ex-service components, either. The isothermal tests are not reproducing important thermomechanical effects from service conditions, and it may be hard to figure out the thermal history of the ex-service examples. In this study a burner rig facility has been used for the evaluation of TBC performance, where a thermal gradient is applied across the TBC at cyclic load and CMAS is continuously injected to the combustion environment to simulate the conditions closer to actual service in an engine while allowing control of important degradation limiting parameters. Tests have been performed on the state of the art material YSZ while loading parameters as high temperature dwell time and CMAS deposition rate have been varied.

Reading ‘theory’ against ‘practice’, they reflect on their own work experiences and upbringings, their curatorial research, and their readings of feminist and Marxist theories of artistic and feminised labour. The discussion considers how the precarious conditions of cultural labour today divide and isolate workers, immersing them in antagonism and competition, and how reflections within feminist art history and theory have possibly downplayed the ongoing (rather than historical) importance of class as well as reproductive labour. Highlighting the dangers of over-identifying with work, the three contributors consider the potential of dis-identifying from work roles and from institutional conventions as one strategy that can potentially challenge the exploitation of the self as well as others.

When the demand of cloud computing instance is low, the surplus of resources is provided at a lower price in the form of spot instance by AWS EC2. This paper proposes DeepSpotCloud that utilizes GPU-equipped spot instances to run deep learning tasks in a cost efficient and fault-tolerant way. Thorough analysis about spot instance price history logs reveals that GPU spot instances show more dynamic price change pattern than other general types of cloud computing resources. To deal with the price dynamicity of the GPU spot instance, DeepSpotCloud utilizes instances in different regions across continents as a single resource pool. This paper also proposes a task migration heuristic by utilizing a checkpointing mechanism of existing deep learning analysis platform to conduct fast task migration when a running spot instance is interrupted. Extensive experiments using real AWS services prove that the proposed task migration method is effective even in a WAN environment with limited network bandwidth. Comprehensive simulations by replaying AWS EC2 price history logs reveal that DeepSpotCloud can achieve 13% more cost gain than a state-of-the-art interrupt-driven scheduling policy. The prototype of DeepSpotCloud is implemented using various cloud computing services provided by AWS to serve real deep learning tasks. © 2017 IEEE.","aws; checkpoint; deep learning; ec2; GPU cloud computing; spot instance; task migration","Cloud computing; Costs; Graphics processing unit; Network function virtualization; Wide area networks; checkpoint; Cloud computing services; Driven scheduling; Network bandwidth; Spot instances; State of the art; Task migration; WAN environment; Deep learning",2-s2.0-85032207590

The main factor influencing transmission is seminal HIV shedding. While the risk of HIV transmission is very low, it is difficult to assess in individuals. Nevertheless, it should be quantified. Results: We retrospectively analysed seminal plasma HIV-1 shedding by 362 treated HIV-infected men attending a medically assisted reproduction centre (1998-2013) in order to determine its frequency, the impact of the antiretroviral regimen on HIV shedding, and to identify shedding patterns. The HIV-1 virus loads in 1396 synchronized blood and semen samples were measured, and antiretroviral treatment, biological and epidemiological data were recorded. We detected isolated HIV-1 shedding into the seminal plasma in 5.3% of patients on efficient antiretroviral treatment, but there was no association with the HIV antiretroviral drug regimen or the CD4 cell count. These men had undergone more regimen changes since treatment initiation and had been on the ongoing drug regimen longer than the non-shedding men. The patterns of HIV seminal shedding among patients with undetectable HIV blood virus load varied greatly. HIV seminal shedding can occur as long as 5years after starting antiretroviral treatment. Conclusions: The seminal HIV load was used to monitor risk for infertile HIV-infected patients on an assisted reproductive technology program. This can still be recommended for patients who recently (6months) started ART, or those with a poor history of adherence to ART but may also be usefull for some patients during counselling. Residual HIV seminal shedding is probably linked to breaks in adherence to antiretroviral treatment but local genital factors cannot be ruled out. © 2017 The Author(s).","Antiretroviral treatment; HIV; Medically assisted reproduction; Semen; Sexual transmission; Sperm processing",,2-s2.0-85028911182

This quality control usually relies on worker screening or contribution reviewing at the cost of additional time and budget overheads. In this paper, we propose to reduce these overheads by leveraging the system history. We describe an offline learning algorithm that groups tasks from history into homogeneous clusters and learns for each cluster the worker features that optimize the contribution quality. These features are then used by the online targeting algorithm to select reliable workers for each incoming task. The proposed method is compared to the state of the art selection methods using real world datasets. Results show that we achieve comparable, and in some cases better, output quality for a smaller budget and shorter time. © 2017 IEEE.","Crowdsourcing; Task clustering; Cost reduction; Offline learning; Worker selection","Application programs; Budget control; Computer software; Cost reduction; Crowdsourcing; Learning algorithms; History-based learning; Homogeneous cluster; Output quality; Real-world datasets; Selection methods; State of the art; Task clustering; Quality control",2-s2.0-85031900514

We compare our approach with several standard forecasting methods, namely Nȧive, Seasonal Nȧive, ARIMA, ETS, STL, and TBATS. From experimental results we make two observations: (i) none of the evaluated forecasting techniques yields consistently good results across all Spot markets, even though Seasonal Nȧive can be considered the most robust when applied to markets with strong seasonal components, and (ii) our proposed technique performs comparably with, and in some cases, outperforms, the state-of-the-art forecasting techniques.

Teachers of history have long recognized this connection and used a range of fictional accounts in their teaching. In this article, we argue that fiction is a double-edged sword that must be handled carefully. On the one hand, it presents compelling characters and accounts that provide powerful connections with the past often missing from school history. On the other hand, the narrative force that draws the reader in and connects him or her to the experience of the characters also mitigates against alternative readings of the situation, undercutting the reader’s ability to understand the past in complex and critical terms. We contend that in the hands of effective teachers, the double-edged sword of fiction can be a valuable and effective tool in the teaching of history. We begin by exploring three scholarly conversations around the nature of history, history education and learning theory. We then discuss the general relationship between history and fiction, move on to describe two broad categories of fiction and their particular connections to history and history teaching and consider some of the tensions between history and fiction. Finally, we investigate pedagogical implications for effective use of fiction in the teaching of history. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","arts; History; history curriculum; history education; history instruction; literature; social studies",,2-s2.0-84990242902

This relationship may be moderated by an individual’s social network characteristics. Our study sought to examine social network correlates of treatment adherence among HIV-positive men recruited from social service agencies throughout Los Angeles County (N = 150) to inform technology-driven social support interventions for this population. We administered egocentric social network and computer-assisted survey interviews focused on demographic characteristics, health history, depressive symptoms, and ART adherence, where adherence was assessed by the number of reasons participants missed taking their medication, if ever. Significant univariate correlates of adherence were included in a multivariable regression analysis, where the moderating effect of having a network member who reminds participants to take their HIV medication on the relationship between depression and adherence was tested. Over 60% of participants reported clinically significant depressive symptoms; this was significantly associated with lower adherence among those without someone in their social network to remind them about taking their HIV medication, even after adjusting for covariates in an ordinary least squares regression (adjusted mean difference b = −1.61, SE = 0.42, p = 0.0003). Having a network member who reminds participants to take their ART medication significantly ameliorated the negative association between depression and treatment adherence, especially for those reporting greater depressive symptoms (p = 0.0394). Additionally, participants demonstrated high rates of technology use to communicate with social network members. In order to achieve the aims of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, innovative interventions addressing mental health to improve ART adherence are needed. Network strategies that leverage technology may be helpful for improving ART adherence among HIV-positive men with comorbid depressive symptoms. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ART adherence; Depression; social networks; technology","anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; adult; aged; antiretroviral therapy; Article; bisexuality; Black person; Caucasian; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; computer; depression; educational status; extended family; female; full time employment; health care survey; Hispanic; homosexual female; homosexual male; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; major clinical study; male; medical technology; medication compliance; network support; patient compliance; priority journal; sexual behavior; sexual orientation; social network; social support",2-s2.0-85019159501

Much of Spoerri?s ?uvre involves the reworking and assemblage of his own collections of found objects. I argue that these imaginative assemblages, which merge human and non-human life, present concrete visions of possible alternative natural histories and prompt us to rethink natural history from a multispecies perspective, where humans and non-humans function as co-agents, and where history and natural history are fused.

However, Wright's concept of the 'Machine' was influenced by Louis Sullivan's organic theories of architecture, which combined Victorian science and idealism. An acknowledgement that Wright's Machine was also metaphysical, the 'Will of Life', resituates his characterization of the arts and crafts movement as anachronistic and elitist. Furthermore, Wright delivered his speech at Hull House and directed much of his criticism at the social settlement workers and indirectly at their neighbours, many of whom participated in craft activities after working on machines all day long. Ellen Gates Starr, bookbinder and co-founder of Hull House, responded to Wright's address and agreed that handwork and social work are not synonymous. She also made it clear that neither she, nor other members of the Chicago Arts and Crafts Society were against the machine. Starr's insight drew upon the conditions of contemporary industrial society, while Wright's conception was based on the power of individual genius. This complicates a persistent narrative that the arts and crafts movement failed because its practitioners made expensive, hand-crafted items and refused to embrace standardization. © 2017 The Author.

Design Retrospective matched cohort study using propensity score (PS) matching (PSM) analysis. Setting University referral centers. Patient(s) A total of 110 women were analyzed from January 2005 to June 2014. A PSM was generated using a logistic regression model based on the age, antimüllerian hormone (AMH) serum level, and presence of adenomyosis to compare the treatment strategy. Intervention(s) First-line surgery group followed by ART versus exclusive ART with in situ colorectal endometriosis. Main Outcome Measure(s) After PSM, pregnancy rates (PRs), live-birth rates (LBRs), and cumulative rates (CRs) were estimated. Result(s) After PSM, in the whole population, the total LBR and PR were 35.4% (39/110) and 49% (54/110), respectively. The specific cumulative LBR at the first ICSI-IVF cycle in the first-line surgery group compared with the first-line ART was, respectively, 32.7% versus 13.0%; at the second cycle, 58.9% versus 24.8%; and at the third cycle, 70.6% versus 54.9%. The cumulative LBRs were significantly higher for women who underwent first-line surgery followed by ART compared with first-line ART in the subset of women with good prognosis (age ≤ 35 years and AMH ≥ 2 ng/mL and no adenomyosis) and women with AMH serum level < 2 ng/mL.

The concept, and the dangers Snow identified, are revisited and applied to social work in this theoretical article, with the science of practice being located in evidence-informed approaches and its art in relationship-based work. Findings: Social work has long incorporated approaches which draw on the strengths of the humanities and science ‘cultures’ respectively, and recognises what each has to offer; it may also be considered to some extent as belonging to a ‘Third Culture’, along with other applied fields. Common to any culture, however, as applied within the profession, must be its ethical base. Applications: As Snow noted, polarity between art and science can lead to common ground being lost which in social work may ultimately disadvantage service users. The professional value base provides the basis for a ‘social work culture’ as long as this is not itself divided by unconstructive schisms. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","art of social work; creativity; knowledge; polarity; relationship-based practice; science of social work; Social work; social work history",,2-s2.0-85028749179

To date, these eponyms have not been systematically investigated. Objectives: This paper provides an overview of this fringe component of medical vocabulary, looks at the history of several terms and formulates hypotheses as to why such creative etymologies have come into being. Materials and methods: In addition to relevant texts on ancient mythology, a variety of medical textbooks from the early modern period were analyzed. Results: Between the 16th and the 20th centuries some 30 figures from Greek and Roman literature made their way into the terminology of medical sciences. A few of these expressions can be encountered in clinical use (e. g., Caput Medusae, Proteus, Oedipus complex) and remain official anatomical (atlas, Achilles tendon) or pharmaceutical nomenclature (atropine, morphine). The choice of these designations has often been similarity of form or analogies in function. Classical eponyms have gained acceptance on account of their succinctness, conciseness and scholarly veneer. Finally, this vocabulary shares its origin with other relevant terminology. Conclusions: In clinical classes, mythological designations can serve as a point of departure for digressions into literary, art and medical history in order to provide an understanding of cultural traditions and enhance education. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","History of medicine; Medicine in art; Medicine in literature; Mythology; Terminology as topic","anatomical concepts; book; early modern period; human; linguistics; medical terminology; nomenclature; Review; scientific literature",2-s2.0-85019203988

In this paper, we propose a simple but effective framework to combine the merits of feature-rich transition-based parsers and RNNs. Specifically, the proposed framework incorporates RNN-based scores into the feature template used by a feature-rich parser.

We wanted to understand why, despite state-of-the-art methods, cervical cancers occured in relationship to programmatic performance at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), where &gt; 1,000,000 women aged ≥ 30 years have undergone cervical cancer screening by triennial HPV and cytology cotesting since 2003. Methods We reviewed clinical histories preceding cervical cancer diagnoses to assign “causes” of cancer. We calculated surrogate measures of programmatic effectiveness (precancers/(precancers and cancers)) and diagnostic yield (precancers and cancers per 1000 cotests), overall and by age at cotest (30–39, 40–49, and ≥ 50 years). Results Cancer was rare and found mainly in a localized (treatable) stage. Of 623 cervical cancers with at least one preceding or concurrent cotest, 360 (57.8%) were judged to be prevalent (diagnosed at a localized stage within one year or regional/distant stage within two years of the first cotest). Non-compliance with recommended screening and management preceded 9.0% of all cancers. False-negative cotests/sampling errors (HPV and cytology negative), false-negative histologic diagnoses, and treatment failures preceded 11.2%, 9.0%, and 4.3%, respectively, of all cancers. There was significant heterogeneity in the causes of cancer by histologic category (p &lt; 0.001 for all; p = 0.002 excluding prevalent cases).

The authors field of view included the events from the history of wars in Europe and Asia, the episodes when European armies, forces of the Ottoman Empire and its allies, as well as. Japan and China acted as the enemy of Russians. The paper also deals with wars and conflicts, invasions and raids of different nature and type. As a result, based upon the findings obtained, many conditions and factors were studied, which influenced the situation of a captive or a group of captives, and enabled them to come through, survive and, moreover, keep hoping for salvation and resist the enemy in various forms and with various activity. The paper singles out the conditions and circumstances that deprive captives of such opportunities. It was established that the situation of captives depended on the nature of antagonisms that caused wars. Examples of conflicts with the participation of Russians showed that the institute of captivity was also influenced by civilization peculiarities of the warring nations, and differences were considered as to how the winners treated their captives at the front and on the home front.

In this respect, it aims to study the process of artistic expression with respect to the relationship between the artist and the work of art. The continuous evolution of human history from the cave to settle life followed by the technological age created as a result of the industrial revolution has created new means and conditions that have been the major shifts in the history of humanity. Although these shifts have created new materials, topics and methods in the creation and distribution of art, they did not alter the unyielding desire for artistic expression, which is the primary topic of interest of this paper. In this respect, the consideration of the link between the artist and the work in the process of creation is categorized under a two-stepped process. The first step of this analysis concentrates on the synthesis of all experience of the individual with respect to belonging and attachment of the individual to the society and to the geography and the artistic content that is produced through one's perspective. This is followed by the second step of artistic creation where the work materializes through an innate process and gets produced. The inevitable dialectic relationship that occurs during the process of artistic expression where the work of art gets produced and while the artist becomes its producer is analysed with regard to these processes. The meaning that finds form through this materialization is questioned in relation to what it means for both the produced work of art and the artist. Centuries long transformation has not altered the consciousness of morality which is the basic impulse that creates the unyielding desire of artistic production irrespective of the environmental condition of its existence and getting to know one's self, materialization of the astonishment towards the incomprehensibility of existence through art and making sense of self are the defined major impulses which give rise to the processes of production. The outlook above and the analysis of the process of creation aims to bring a comprehensive fresh perspective to the notion of unaltered artistic production of synthesized works of art and the continuity of artistic expression and the process of creation.","Artistic expression; Artistic process; Modern art",,2-s2.0-85028953219

We compared the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms between women seeking for infertility treatment and women who conceived after ART or naturally. Methods Four hundred and sixty-eight sub-fertile non-pregnant women, 2972 naturally pregnant women and 143 women pregnant after ART completed a questionnaire in this cross-sectional study. The Anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A≥8) and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS≥12) were used for assessing anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively. Multivariate Poisson regression models with robust variance were applied to explore associations with anxiety and depressive symptoms. Results The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among sub-fertile, non-pregnant women (57.6% and 15.7%, respectively) were significantly higher compared to women pregnant after ART (21.1% and 8.5%, respectively) and naturally pregnant women (18.8% and 10.3%, respectively). History of psychiatric diagnosis was identified as an independent risk factor for both anxiety and depressive symptoms. The presence of at least one unhealthy lifestyle behavior (daily tobacco smoking, weekly alcohol consumption, BMI≥25, and regular physical exercise < 2 h/week) was also associated with anxiety (Prevalence Ratio, PR: 1.24; 95%CI: 1.09–1.40) and depressive symptoms (PR: 1.25; 95%CI: 1.04–1.49). Conclusions Women pregnant after ART showed no difference in anxiety and depressive symptoms compared to naturally pregnant women. However, early psychological counseling and management of unhealthy lifestyle behaviors for sub-fertile women may be advisable, particularly for women with a previous history of psychiatric diagnosis. © 2017","Anxiety; Assisted reproductive technology (ART); Depression; Infertility; Pregnancy","adult; alcohol consumption; anxiety; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; cross-sectional study; depression; distress syndrome; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; exercise; female; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; human; infertility; infertility therapy; lifestyle; major clinical study; pregnancy; pregnant woman; prevalence; priority journal; questionnaire; risk factor; smoking; symptom",2-s2.0-85029809957

Recently, with accumulation of users and contents, much concern has arisen over the efficiency and answer quality of CQA services. To address this problem, question routing has been proposed which aims at routing new questions to suitable answerers, who have both high possibility and high ability to answer the questions. In this paper, we formulate question routing as a multi-objective ranking problem, and present a multi-objective learning-to-rank approach for question routing (MLQR), which can simultaneously optimize the answering possibility and answer quality of routed users. In MLQR, realizing that questions are relatively short and usually attached with tags, we first propose a tagword topic model (TTM) to derive topical representations of questions. Based on TTM, we then develop features for each question-user pair, which are captured at both platform level and thread level. In particular, the platform-level features summarize the information of a user from his/her history posts in the CQA platform, while the thread-level features model the pairwise competitions of a user with others in his/her answered threads. Finally, we extend a state-of-the-art learning-to-rank algorithm for training a multi-objective ranking model. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets show that our MLQR can outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of both answering possibility and answer quality. © 1989-2012 IEEE.","Community question answering services; multiple-objective optimization; question routing","Truck trailers; Community question answering; Features modeling; Multi-objective learning; Multi-objective ranking; Multiple-objective optimization; question routing; Real-world datasets; State-of-the-art methods; Multiobjective optimization",2-s2.0-85029382680

The CNO isotope yields of super-AGB stars, novae and fast-rotating massive stars are included. Having reproduced the available isotope enrichment data in the solar neighbourhood, and across the Galaxy, and having assessed the sensitivity of our models to the remaining uncertainties, e.g. nova yields and star formation history, we show that we can meaningfully constrain the stellar IMF in galaxies using C, O and N isotope abundance ratios. In starburst galaxies, where data for multiple isotopologue lines are available, we find compelling new evidence for a top-heavy stellar IMF, with profound implications for their star formation rates and efficiencies, perhaps also their stellar masses. Neither chemical fractionation nor selective photodissociation can significantly perturb globally averaged isotopologue abundance ratios away from the corresponding isotope ones, as both these processes will typically affect only small mass fractions of molecular clouds in galaxies. Thus, the Atacama LargeMillimeter Array now stands ready to probe the stellar IMF, and even the ages of specific starburst events in star-forming galaxies across cosmic time unaffected by the dust obscuration effects that plague optical/near-infrared studies. © 2017 The Author.

Their concerns center on issues of meaning and ownership as well as on the value of intellectual and material cultural property. Since 1997, the stone's original owners in Magam have been appealing for its repatriation; they wish to either own it again or at least have a connection to it by being recognized as the proper owners. Based on fieldwork in the archipelago, primarily on Ambrym in 2009–10, I position these discussions within the contemporary context of the ongoing revival of kastom as well as the development of tourism.

The scientific representation became more common from the onset of the seventeenth century when the scientific method was developed; nevertheless, some scientific representations of plants were realized before by some authors having a realistic approach to arts. The paper analyzes different types of representations through the centuries of two exotic medicinal and edible plants: Momordica balsamina and M. charantia. The examples presented and discussed derive from a search of images made by the authors directly from museums and libraries and from the net searching of artworks as still life and others where plants are more commonly represented. Illustrated herbaria, used for medicinal purposes, printed books having a botanical subject, devotional pictures, two Italian still lifes of the seventeenth century and two early nineteenth century American still lifes, where Momordica is depicted, are described and the modality of representation and botanical diagnostic details analyzed. Also the hypothesized years of the introduction in Europe of these exotic species should be dated back. It was astonishing to detect that the Italian devotional picture contains, with the exception of roots, almost all the diagnostic characters of Momordica balsamina, represented scientifically, comprising also the presence of flowers of both sexes and fruits with different stages of ripening: this was with the awareness of plant sexuality revealed by Camerarius only 100 years later. © 2017, Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei.","History of botany; M. charantia; Momordica balsamina; Plant representation; Plant sexuality representation; Scientific representation","Agricultural engineering; Earth sciences; History of botany; M. charantia; Momordica balsamina; Plant representation; Plant sexuality representation; Scientific representation; Plants (botany)",2-s2.0-85023740007

In order to explore how the spatial information of floor to floor transitions is represented cognitively, a user study was conducted at the Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History that drew on experienced participants from the Visitor Services Department. The participants were asked to give wayfinding descriptions to and from several landmarks in the museums with the majority of the routes spanning multiple floors. It was found that floor to floor transition points were often represented as landmarks with notable locations in the Museums being represented with both functional and referential aspects. A functional aspect of a floor to floor transition points meant that its purpose in the wayfinding description was to provide a means to get from one floor to another. A referential quality meant that a floor to floor transition points was simply an indemnity and did not serve as a way to move vertically through the environment.

ART was initiated in 2271 participants (99.0%) in the immediate and 1127 (48.3%) in the deferred arm, accounting for &gt;94% and &gt;19% of follow-up time, respectively. Overall, 89% started ART using a tenofovir-based regimen. Over 2.1 years median follow-up, mean eGFR was 0.56 (95% CI 0.003–1.11) higher in the immediate versus deferred arm, which was more prominent after adjustment for current tenofovir or bPI use (1.85, 95% CI 1.21–2.50) and in Black participants (30.1% overall) (3.90, 95% CI 2.84–4.97) versus non-Blacks (1.05, 95% CI 0.33–1.77) (P &lt; 0.001 for interaction). Relative risk for proteinuria in the immediate versus deferred arm was 0.74 (95% CI 0.55–1.00) (P = 0.049). In the short-term, immediate ART initiation was associated with a modestly higher eGFR and lower proteinuria risk versus deferring ART (more pronounced in Black participants).

To promote teaching for creativity in Vietnam, Assessment Criteria of a Lesson for Creativity (ACLC) was developed. It was used in guiding and assessing the teachers’ preparation and implementation of lessons for creativity in a quasi-experimental design in one upper and one lower secondary school in Hanoi, Vietnam. This paper reports how the ACLC was developed and used in chemistry, history, language arts, and mathematics grade 10 classrooms at the upper secondary school in the 2015–2016 school year. Findings indicate that the ACLC effectively supported the teachers in their preparation and implementation of teaching for creativity at these Vietnamese secondary schools.

This journal served the scientific and intellectual aspects of the Faculty of Engineering and Architecture at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. He aims to fully demonstrate not only the journal's internal development over the years but also the entirety of the contemporary scientific research of the time. This was supported by a study published in three languages (Hungarian, English and German) in 2007 written by four experts. It was a comprehensive, evaluative piece that analysed the main scope of work, and included a summarising table of contents. The era of the ÉKTK (1957-1968) covers an even wider field which is the developmental period of the scientific fields of academic research. From 1969, in the period of the ÉÉT, the common field of theoretical and applied mechanics and the building sciences made up the engineering specialisation, while the other consisted of architecture, history of architecture, monuments and urban studies. The year 2000 was a special year in the journal's life with the start of the digital age. The effects of internal changes within the university, like the introduction of the doctoral schools amongst other institutional changes, could already be felt in the 1990s. In his article, the author summarises the most important findings written by the four experts. Erno′ Marosi, art historian, analysed the connections between architectural history, monuments and theory of architecture.

One of the challenges inherent in targeting these pathogens with drugs is the tight integration of the viral life cycle with the host's cellular machinery. However, the reliance of the virus on the host cell replication machinery is also an opportunity for therapeutic targeting, as successful entry- and exit-inhibitors have demonstrated. An understanding of the extracellular and intracellular structure and dynamics of the virion – as well as of the entry and exit pathways in host and vector cells – is therefore crucial to the advancement of novel antivirals. In recent years, advances in computing architecture and algorithms have begun to allow us to use simulations to study the structure and dynamics of viral ultrastructures at various stages of their life cycle in atomistic or near-atomistic detail. In this review, we outline specific challenges and solutions that have emerged to allow for structurally detailed modelling of viruses in silico. We focus on the history and state of the art of atomistic and coarse-grained approaches to simulate the dynamics of the large, macromolecular structures associated with viral infection, and on their usefulness in explaining and expanding upon experimental data. We discuss the types of interactions that need to be modeled to describe major components of the virus particle and advances in modelling techniques that allow for the treatment of these systems, highlighting recent key simulation studies. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Coarse graining; Lipid membranes; Molecular dynamics simulations; Multi-scale modelling; Self-assembly; Viral pathogens","chemistry; human; molecular dynamics; viral phenomena and functions; virus; virus infection; Humans; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Virus Diseases; Virus Physiological Phenomena; Viruses",2-s2.0-84993945018

These studies have been very helpful in improving the injectivity. However, there are still many problems remaining for further investigations, among which characterization of the complete process of water-rock interactions during reinjection with the change in redox conditions, CO2 partial pressure, non-isothermal transport process of the reinjection water, and the mechanism of release, transport and sedimentation of colloidal particles on reservoir permeability being taken into account are considered to be the most necessary.

Scholars often consider such inscriptions within a frame of literal reference, as alternative sources of documentary evidence and/or as ekphrastic descriptions of the object on which they appear. Moving beyond mimesis, this study takes up the figurative dimensions of poetry, exemplified here by the trope of prosopopeia, which gives a fictive voice to inanimate objects and allows the inscribed gifts to speak for themselves and to their recipients. The essay demonstrates the significance of recited and inscribed poetry in the gift economy of the Islamicate world. It shows the widespread nature of the phenomenon by outlining the history of poetic inscriptions, with special attention to the use of the first-person voice, from Graeco-Roman antiquity to Byzantium and on to the Islamicate world. Narrowing the focus to medieval Iberia, it offers a case study of a tenth-century ivory pyxis made near Umayyad Cordoba to test the value of introducing a theory of prosopopeia, and the analysis of poetic figuration more generally, to the study of luxury gifts in the Islamicate world. Prosopopeia, I argue, makes objects into subjects through the speaking ""I,"" and with the performance of subjectivity comes the construction of agency. In the case of the Umayyad pyxis, a reading attentive to the prosopopeia in the inscription helps restore agency to women in the gift exchange.

At present, terms from the informal register of language are used in scientific research even if they are ideologically charged and based on an elitist, ethnocentric and biased view of the social reality. Furthermore, the division between Musicology-focused on the study of history and science of Western Art music- and Ethnomusicology-which makes its research on other societies and other social groups, especially, rural ones-represents a hindrance for scientific activity. These paternalistic and discriminatory values must be overcome with holistic approaches. We need to surpass the ideological apriorism and combine the multidisciplinary and critical point of views in order to identify the characteristics of each society. In order to analyze the capitalist societies' musical environment, we focus our proposal onto the concept of power. So, we rescue the theoretical paradigm from Jesús Ibáñez who identifies the elites as the only group capable of extracting information from other social classes while, simultaneously, injecting negentropy in order to preserve the status quo. Furthermore, we include his theoretical work on thermodynamic processes of capitalism production, circulation and consumption. We suggest, thus, a double division based on whether the production and/or the reproduction is reserved for upper classes or shared with subordinate classes. Our work proposes a new terminology based on the logics from the artistic events and away from acritical approaches. In conclusion, this is a theoretical proposal which matches the scientific rigor with which we intend to reveal the great musical myth: how the upper classes used to hide their domain of the productive resources with a magical and esoteric discourse.","Capitalism; Depersonalized music; Participative music; Sociomusicology; Terminology; Theorization",,2-s2.0-85029690678

Studies from developed countries report high viral load, low CD4 counts, and anti-retroviral therapy (ART) to be associated with OLD; but these findings may not be generalizable to populations in resource-limited settings. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study of lung function in 730 HIV-infected black South African adults. Pre-bronchodilator spirometry was performed at enrollment and repeated annually for three years. Logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with OLD, defined as FEV1/FVC&lt;0.70, at enrollment. Excess annual declines in FEV1 and FVC were modelled as the product-term of follow-up time and exposures using random effects regression. Results Median (IQR) age at enrollment was 36 (32–41) years, 85% were female and 30% ever-smoked with a median (IQR) exposure of 3 (1–6) pack-years. Median (IQR) CD4 count and viral load at enrollment were 372 (261–518) cells/mm3 and 2655 (91–13,548) copies/mL respectively. Overall, 25% were receiving ART at enrollment, 16% of whom reported at least 6 months of ART receipt. OLD was found in 35 (5%) at enrollment. Increasing age (aOR = 2.08 per 10-years [95%CI 1.22–3.57], p = 0.007), current smoking (aOR = 3.55 [95%CI 1.20–10.53], p = 0.02), and CRP (aOR = 1.01 per unit-increase [95%CI 1.00–1.03], p = 0.04) were significantly associated with OLD at enrollment; while increasing CD4 count (aOR = 1.02 per-100 cells/mm3 [95%CI 0.85–1.22], p = 0.82), viral load (aOR = 0.67 per log-increase [95%CI 0.43–1.10], p = 0.12) and receipt of ART (aOR = 0.57 [95%CI 0.18–1.75], p = 0.32) were not. The median (IQR) follow-up time was 18 (12–24) months. Participants with a history of tuberculosis (TB) had a 35 mL (95%CI 2–68, p = 0.03) and 57 mL (95%CI 19–96, p = 0.003) per year excess loss of FEV1 and FVC respectively. Conclusion Prevalent OLD was associated with older age, current smoking and higher CRP levels, but not CD4 counts and ART, in HIV-infected South African adults.

The study builds on the results of thousands of nonlinear response-time history analyses of SDOF systems, using almost one hundred ground motions pairs. Residual displacements arising from both individual earthquakes and sequences of seismic ground motions are considered. Based on regression analysis of results, a closed-form equation is derived to predict residual displacements of spherical friction-based isolation systems as a function of the main parameters governing their mechanical behavior.

Whether this replacement is beneficial for drug-treated patients with cardiac disease is not yet clear. Objective: In a prospective study of Dutch patients with cardiac disease (Alpha Omega Cohort), we examined the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and IHD mortality when the sum of SFAs and trans fatty acids (TFAs) was theoretically replaced by total UFAs, PUFAs, or cis monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). Design: We included 4146 state-of-the-art drug-treated patients aged 60-80 y with a history of myocardial infarction (79% male patients) and reliable dietary data at baseline (2002-2006). Cause-specific mortality was monitored until 1 January 2013. HRs for CVD mortality and IHD mortality for theoretical, isocaloric replacement of dietary fatty acids (FAs) in quintiles (1-5) and continuously (per 5% of energy) were obtained from Cox regression models, adjusting for demographic factors, medication use, and lifestyle and dietary factors. Results: Patients consumed, on average, 17.5% of energy of total UFAs, 13.0% of energy of SFAs, and <1% of energy of TFAs. During 7 y of follow-up, 372 CVD deaths and 249 IHD deaths occurred. Substitution modeling yielded significantly lower risks of CVD mortality when replacing SFAs plus TFAs with total UFAs [HR in quintile 5 compared with quintile 1: 0.45 (95% CI: 0.28, 0.72)] or PUFAs [HR: 0.66 (95% CI: 0.44, 0.98)], whereas HRs in cis MUFA quintiles were nonsignificant. HRs were similar for IHD mortality. In continuous analyses, replacement of SFAs plus TFAs with total UFAs, PUFAs, or cis MUFAs (per 5% of energy) was associated with significantly lower risks of CVD mortality (HRs between 0.68 and 0.75) and IHD mortality (HRs between 0.55 and 0.70). Conclusion: Shifting the FA composition of the diet toward a higher proportion of UFAs may lower CVD mortality risk in drug-treated patients with cardiac disease. © 2017 American Society for Nutrition.","Cardiac patients; Cardiovascular disease; Coronary heart disease; Dietary fatty acids; Prospective cohort study; Substitution analysis","anticoagulant agent; antihypertensive agent; antilipemic agent; fatty acid; monounsaturated fatty acid; saturated fatty acid; trans fatty acid; unsaturated fatty acid; adult; aged; Article; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk; cohort analysis; demography; diet; drug use; Dutchman; fat intake; heart infarction; human; ischemic heart disease; lifestyle; major clinical study; proportional hazards model; prospective study; sensitivity analysis",2-s2.0-85028710090

A tool for ranking all the source files with respect to how likely they are to contain the cause of the bug would enable developers to narrow down their search and improve productivity. This project introduces an adaptive ranking approach that leverages project knowledge through functional decomposition of source code, API descriptions of library components, the bug-fixing history, the code change history, and the file dependency graph. Given a bug report, the ranking score of each source file is computed as a weighted combination of an array of features, where the weights are trained automatically on previously solved bug reports using a learning-to-rank technique. I applied SVM (Support Virtual Machine) to classify the bug reports to identify, which category the bug belongs to. It helps to fix the critical defects early. The ranking system evaluated on six large scale open source Java projects, using the before-fix version of the project for every bug report. The experimental results show that the learning-to-rank approach outperforms three recent state-of-the-art methods. In particular, proposed method makes correct recommendations within the top 10 ranked source files for over 70 percent of the bug reports in the Eclipse Platform and Tomcat projects.","CF(collaborative Filtering); Learning to rank; Preprocessing; SVM",,2-s2.0-85028011199

In the twenty-first century, the fear of forgetting seems increasingly obsolete in the face of social media tools like Facebook's ""See Your Memories: Never Miss a Memory"" feature, which excavates photos uploaded, shared, or tagged on the site years ago, reminding users to ""look back"" on otherwise lost memories. However, in recent Chinese fiction (Ma Jian's Beijing Coma; Chan Koonchung's The Fat Years; Liu Cixin's ""The Weight of Memories""), the trope of dormant memories remains noticeably prevalent, reflecting an urgent cultural concern about the conscious ""act of deleting memories"" (Yan Lianke) in the process of recording modern Chinese history. Whether in the form of documentary-style animation (i.Mirror, 2007), zombie-horror film (Haze and Fog, 2013), or stop-motion train-replica dioramas (La Town, 2014), Cao Fei fantasizes about a new posthuman consciousness, whose most serious trespass against humanity is not forgetting, but rather not feeling. Presenting disjointed scenes that call upon instances of trauma and surveillance, Cao's ""posthuman trilogy"" films suggest that when cosmopolitan memories become decontextualized, mere images no longer possess any meaningful symbolic power. Further, Cao's films demonstrate that voyeurism becomes an unavoidable yet inconsequential daily practice in the digital age of exhibition.","China; Exhibition; Memory; Museum; New media; Posthuman; Trauma; Zombie",,2-s2.0-85030774350

Such devices include LEDs, lasers, detectors, electroabsorption modulators and devices based on intersubband transitions in AlGaN quantum wells (QWs). After a brief history of the development of the field, we describe how the unique crystal structure, chemical bonding, and resulting spontaneous and piezoelectric polarizations in heterostructures affect the design, fabrication and performance of devices based on these materials. The heteroepitaxial growth and the formation and role of extended defects are addressed. The role of the chemical bonding in the formation of metallic contacts to this class of materials is also addressed. A detailed discussion is then presented on potential origins of the high performance of blue LEDs and poorer performance of green LEDs (green gap), as well as of the efficiency reduction of both blue and green LEDs at high injection current (efficiency droop). The relatively poor performance of deep-UV LEDs based on AlGaN alloys and methods to address the materials issues responsible are similarly addressed. Other devices whose state-of-the-art performance and materials-related issues are reviewed include violet-blue lasers, 'visible blind' and 'solar blind' detectors based on photoconductive and photovoltaic designs, and electroabsorption modulators based on bulk GaN or GaN/AlGaN QWs.

In recent years, epitope-based subunit vaccines have been introduced as a safer alternative to traditional vaccines. However, they suffer from limited immunogenicity. Nanotechnology has shown value in solving this issue. Different kinds of nanovaccines have been employed, among which virus-like nanoparticles (VLPs) and self-assembled peptide nanoparticles (SAPNs) seem very promising. Recently, SAPNs have attracted special interest due to their unique properties, including molecular specificity, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. They also resemble pathogens in terms of their size. Their multivalency allows an orderly repetitive display of antigens on their surface, which induces a stronger immune response than single immunogens. In vaccine design, SAPN self-adjuvanticity is regarded an outstanding advantage, since the use of toxic adjuvants is no longer required. SAPNs are usually composed of helical or β-sheet secondary structures and are tailored from natural peptides or de novo structures. Flexibility in subunit selection opens the door to a wide variety of molecules with different characteristics. SAPN engineering is an emerging area, and more novel structures are expected to be generated in the future, particularly with the rapid progress in related computational tools.

Due to limited connectivity, DTN is vulnerable to flooding attack in which malicious nodes flood the network with superfluous data to deplete the network resources. Existing works mitigate internal flooding attacks by rate-limit to constrain the number of messages that nodes can generate per time slot. However, rate-limit cannot flexibly accommodate burst traffic in which nodes may have sending demands higher than the rate-limit for a short period. In this paper, we propose FDER to detect flooding attack and yet allow legitimate burst traffic simultaneously. Nodes exchange their histories of encounter records (ER) which record the sent messages during their previous encounters. The ER history is used to infer a node&#x0027;s new message transmission rate over time and the number of forwarded replicas per message. The adversary nodes that send too many messages or replicas can thus be detected. Since ERs serve as useful tools for monitoring the sending behavior of nodes over a long time period, FDER could detect the burst traffic violation efficiently. We also design FP - a fairness forwarding policy to ensure fairness in the delivery performance fairness between nodes with normal traffic and those with burst traffic. FP uses ER information to observe nodes&#x0027; rate of new message generation and adjust their forwarding priorities accordingly. Simulation results show that FDER can detect flooding attack at a higher accuracy and a lower delay compared to state-of-the-art scheme with affordable overhead. Moreover, FP could mitigate the smart flooding attack and still provide the performance fairness to support bursty traffic scenario.

The way in which institutions and especially the Faculty of Theology at the University of Pretoria facilitated symbolic ‘walls’ was discussed in the overview of the Department of Science of Religion and Missiology in the first century of the Faculty of Theology. The concepts of ‘gatekeepers’ and ‘traders’ were then applied because walls, paradoxically, need gates to facilitate control, movement and, eventually, life. Gatekeepers were described as the guardians of the status quo, and traders as agents who, in one way or another, facilitate movement, trade, flow and life in the midst of the shadows of walls. Missionaries are, by the very nature of the missionary enterprise, more traders than gatekeepers. Here, the work of Bosch - specifically his ground-breaking work on mission as contextualisation - provides an explanation of the art of mission as breaking down walls, opening gates and empowering traders. That is precisely why Missiology is particularly well suited to assist the church and theology in the art of breaking down walls. The theological imperative of contextualisation means that the life of the church, theology, and thus theological training, cannot do without Missiology. The concept of ‘deep contextualisation’ was discussed as a particularly relevant approach to include a post-anthropomorphic discourse in Missiology. It can assist with the reorientation of the history of mission on the whole of history and, thus, also deep history. The concept also provides a way to address the discourses on colonialisation and includes a reorientation on the future and embracing hope. © 2017. The Authors.",,,2-s2.0-85029653275

However, many of the state-of-the-art approaches finding success deal with the extrapolation of stationary time series feeds, with little to no consideration of more complex but expected events in the data. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel modeling approach for examining refueling behaviors in GCs, with a focus on estimating their health state from vibration data. A machine learning model was constructed using the operational history of a unit experiencing an eventual inspection-based failure. This new approach to examining GC condition is shown to correspond well with explicit remaining useful life measurements of the case study, improving on the existing rudimentary extrapolation methods often employed in rotating machinery health monitoring.

Most existing approaches rely on traditional machine learning with manual feature engineering, which requires a lot of expertise and effort. Furthermore, it is known that there is no general perfect feature set because information leak always occurs in feature extraction phase. Also, for each language of Wikipedia, a new feature set is required. In this paper, we present an approach relying on deep learning for quality classification of Wikipedia articles. Our solution relies on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) which is an endto-end learning technique that eliminates disadvantages of feature engineering.

My goal was to gather accurate and precise measurable data. At the time, I wasn't interested in nutrition as a discipline defined in its more general or popular sense. To address the specific problem that interested me required development of entirely new methods based on stable, nonradioactive tracers that satisfied the conditions of accuracy and precision. At the time, I had no inclination of the various theoretical and practical problems that would have to be solved to achieve this goal. Some are briefly described here. Nor did I have the slightest idea that developing the field would result in a fundamental change in how human clinical investigation was conducted, with the eventual replacement of radiotracers with stable isotopically labeled ones, even for adult clinical investigation. Additionally, I had no inclination that the original questions would open avenues to much broader questions of practical nutritional relevance. Moreover, only much later as the editor of The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition did I appreciate the policy implications of how nutritional data are presented in the scientific literature. At least in part, less accurate and precise measurements and less than full transparency in reporting nutritional data have resulted in widespread debate about the public policy recommendations and guidelines that are the intended result of collecting the data in the first place.

The genotypic and phenotypic data share common evolutionary origins - namely, the evolutionary history of sampled organisms - introducing covariance which must be distinguished from the covariance due to biological function that is of primary interest in GWA studies. A variety of methods have been introduced to perform AM while accounting for sample relatedness. However, the state of the art predominantly utilizes the simplifying assumption that sample relatedness is effectively fixed across the genome. In contrast, population genetic theory and empirical studies have shown that sample relatedness can vary greatly across different loci within a genome. This phenomenon - referred to as local genealogical variation - is commonly encountered in many genomic datasets. New AM methods are needed to better account for local variation in sample relatedness within genomes. We address this gap by introducing Coal-Miner, a new statistical AM method. The Coal-Miner algorithm takes the form of a methodological pipeline. The initial stages of Coal-Miner seek to detect candidate loci, or loci which contain putatively associated markers. Subsequent stages of Coal-Miner perform test for association using a linear mixed model with multiple effects which account for sample relatedness locally within candidate loci and globally across the entire genome. Using synthetic and empirical datasets, we compare the statistical power and type I error control of Coal-Miner against state-of-the-art AM methods. The simulation conditions reflect a variety of genomic architectures for complex traits and incorporate a range of evolutionary scenarios, each with different evolutionary processes that can generate local genealogical variation. Across the datasets in our study, we find that Coal-Miner consistently offers comparable or typically better statistical power and type I error control compared to the state-of-the-art methods. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Arabidopsis; Coalescent; Genealogy; Genome wide association study; Gwas; Population stratification","Bioinformatics; Biology; Coal; Coal mines; Computation theory; Genes; Arabidopsis; Coalescent; Genealogy; Genome-wide association studies; Gwas; Population stratification; Miners",2-s2.0-85031327881

The high resolution of cavity axion detectors can make use of modern cosmological structure-formation simulations, which begin from realistic initial conditions, incorporate a wide range of baryonic physics, and are capable of resolving detailed structure. This work uses a state-of-the-art cosmological N-body+Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics simulation to develop an improved signal model for axion cavity searches.

The body was, like in all performances, a cornerstone of its educational action. Drawing on both traditions, the classical and the popular one, the Reformers were able to build a “site-specific” theatrical pedagogy of the body in which the individual body of the hero and the collective body of the community acted in different roles, and in which the city, with its political and religious identity, was rethought as the place where the Volksgeist came to life and the glorious histories of the Bible were revived by and for the “chosen ones”.

On the other hand, simplified approaches, based on linear static analysis, are affected by strong limitations of use and loss of accuracy towards seismic performance assessment. In this paper, an alternative approach, referred to as Multiple Inelastic Mechanisms Analysis (MIMA), based on the principles of the Displacement-based Assessment (DBA) method, is proposed in the attempt of reducing the complexity related to NRHAs, while maintaining a sufficient accurateness in the estimation of expected losses. MIMA is a practice-oriented approach that provides the seismic response of a structure at different intensity levels. The most important novelties of MIMA with respect to the current state-of-the-art are the possibility of accounting for the contribution of different inelastic mechanisms, the record-to-record variability, and the effects of infills and stairs. In the current version, the proposed approach is specialized for pre-70 RC frame buildings. However, it could be extended to other building types with minor efforts. In this paper, MIMA is applied on a six-stories building, representative of typical RC frame buildings realized in Italy (and other European countries) in the 60’s and 70’s. A good accordance between approximate predictions and accurate results (from NRHAs) is observed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Displacement-based Assessment; Multiple inelastic mechanisms; RC frame buildings; Record-to-record variability; Seismic performance assessment; Simplified methods of analysis","Buildings; Seismic design; Seismic response; Seismic waves; Seismology; Displacement-Based; Inelastic mechanisms; RC frames; Record-to-record variability; Seismic performance assessment; Simplified method; Earthquake engineering; assessment method; building; displacement; elasticity; estimation method; ground motion; reinforced concrete; seismic response; structural analysis; Italy",2-s2.0-85019637486

The key component of a taxi-booking app is the dispatch system which aims to provide optimal matches between drivers and riders. Traditional dispatch systems sequentially dispatch taxis to riders and aim to maximize the driver acceptance rate for each individual order. However, the traditional systems may lead to a low global success rate, which degrades the rider experience when using the app. In this paper, we propose a novel system that attempts to optimally dispatch taxis to serve multiple bookings. The proposed system aims to maximize the global success rate, thus it optimizes the overall travel efficiency, leading to enhanced user experience. To further enhance users' experience, we also propose a method to predict destinations of a user once the taxi-booking APP is started. The proposed method employs the Bayesian framework to model the distribution of a user's destination based on his/her travel histories. We use rigorous A/B tests to compare our new taxi dispatch method with state-of-the-art models using data collected in Beijing. Experimental results show that the proposed method is significantly better than other state-of-the art models in terms of global success rate (increased from 80% to 84%). Moreover, we have also achieved significant improvement on other metrics such as user's waiting-time and pick-up distance. For our destination prediction algorithm, we show that our proposed model is superior to the baseline model by improving the top-3 accuracy from 89% to 93%. The proposed taxi dispatch and destination prediction algorithms are both deployed in our online systems and serve tens of millions of users everyday. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Circular distribution; Combinatorial optimization; Destination prediction; Taxi dispatch","Combinatorial optimization; Data mining; Forecasting; Online systems; Optimization; User interfaces; Bayesian frameworks; Circular distribution; Driver acceptance; Fast response time; Prediction algorithms; Taxi dispatches; Traditional systems; Users' experiences; Taxicabs",2-s2.0-85029094784

A better understanding of the contribution to transmission of people at different stages of the care pathway can help focus intervention services at populations where they may have the greatest effect. We investigate this using Uganda as a case study. Methods: An individual-based HIV/ART model was fitted using history matching. 100 model fits were generated to account for uncertainties in sexual behaviour, HIV epidemiology, and ART coverage up to 2015 in Uganda. A number of different ART scale-up intervention scenarios were simulated between 2016 and 2030. The incidence and proportion of transmission over time from people with primary infection, post-primary ART-naïve infection, and people currently or previously on ART was calculated. Results: In all scenarios, the proportion of transmission by ART-naïve people decreases, from 70% (61%-79%) in 2015 to between 23% (15%-40%) and 47% (35%-61%) in 2030. The proportion of transmission by people on ART increases from 7.8% (3.5%-13%) to between 14% (7.0%-24%) and 38% (21%-55%). The proportion of transmission by ART dropouts increases from 22% (15%-33%) to between 31% (23%-43%) and 56% (43%-70%). Conclusions: People who are currently or previously on ART are likely to play an increasingly large role in transmission as ART coverage increases in Uganda. Improving retention on ART, and ensuring that people on ART remain virally suppressed, will be key in reducing HIV incidence in Uganda. © 2017 The Author(s).","ART; HIV; Retention; Sub-Saharan Africa; Transmission; Uganda","antiretrovirus agent; adolescent; adult; antiretroviral therapy; Article; case study; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; incidence; male; sexual behavior; treatment outcome; treatment retention; Uganda; virus inhibition; virus transmission",2-s2.0-85027114763

Notable films include Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994), Bean (1997), The Borrowers (1997) and Notting Hill (1999). This paper examines the origins of this production strategy between 1988 and 1993. During these six years, Working Title was transformed from an independently owned and managed production company which largely produced Channel 4-funded ‘social art cinema’ to a subsidiary label of the nascent film studio, PolyGram Filmed Entertainment (PFE). Taking the approach of business history, I will explore PFE’s key innovations, particularly the development of the so-called ‘control sheet’, a creative and commercial filter used to inform green-light decisions. In so doing, a complex and dynamic picture of film-making within a newly formed studio system emerges. Significantly, control sheet-like business practices were also adopted by the major Hollywood studios. Thus, the logic of the control sheet continues to underpin the current media ecology of Hollywood at large, including that of Working Title’s current parent company, Universal. © 2017 IAMHIST & Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group",,,2-s2.0-85026905645

Understanding the underlying mechanisms of the various fundamental processes has always been the goal of chemistry, physics, biology and materials science. With Ahmed Zewail's pioneering work in the field of femtoscience, the time-resolved electron diffraction, combining the pump-probe and electron diffraction technique, has become an excellent tool with sufficient temporal precision to directly deliver insights into ultrafast phenomena on an atomic level. Central to this method is the ultrashort electron pulses generated from a metal photocathode. However, up to now, owing to the initial size, effective temperature, energy dispersion and inherent coulomb repulsion of electron source, the state-of-the-art transverse coherence of conventional planar cathode photoemission source is still insufficient to resolve the complex chemical and biological organic molecules. Hence, in recent years, many efforts have focused on developing high-coherence ultrashort electron sources. The main methods include minimizing the initial beam size, weakening the space charge, reducing the effective temperature, and matching the photon energy of laser with the work function of cathode material. In this review, we firstly summarize the history and advantages of the electron probe, secondly sketch out the figure of merit of the electron source. And then taking coherence as the main line, we review recent progress in common planar photoemission sources, and discuss the latest development of tip-based electron sources and cold atom electron sources in terms of their generation mechanisms, unique properties and research progress. Finally, the development and future applications of the diffraction technique are prospected. In general, the high-coherence length of photoelectric surface source is often at the expense of the current. The needle source can obtain the highest coherence length, but it is similar to femtosecond single-electron pulse, which must be less than one electron per pulse to eliminate the electron-electron coulomb interaction. Thus, a diffraction pattern can only be formed by accumulating millions of shots. The cold atom electron source, which has a transverse coherence greater than 15 nm and a peak brightness similar to conventional electron source's, is sufficient for some molecular systems in biochemistry. In short, with the improvement of coherence and the emergence of new electron sources, it is possible to reveal complex organic and inorganic structures, especially the dynamic behaviors of protein, and promote the understanding of nanoscale energy transport, solid-liquid and solid-gas interfacial dynamics and chemical reaction and so on. High-coherence electron sources not only serve in the diffraction experiments, but also play a key role in developing ultrafast electron microscopy, coherent diffraction imaging and ptychography. © 2017 Chinese Physical Society.","Cold atom electron sources; Molecular movie; Nanotip electron sources; Time-resolved electron diffraction","Atoms; Cathodes; Dispersions; Dynamics; Electrodes; Electron diffraction; Electron sources; Photoemission; Probes; Temperature; Coherent diffraction imaging; Cold atoms; Diffraction techniques; Effective temperature; Molecular movie; Single electron pulse; Time-resolved electron diffraction; Ultrafast electron microscopy; Electrons",2-s2.0-85031307158

This paper presents a literature review dealing with classical and advanced approaches on rocking motion with particular reference to masonry walls characterized by a monolithic behavior. Firstly , the pioneering work of Housner based on the concept of the inverted pendulum is discussed in terms of the most significant parameters , i.e. , the size and slenderness of the blocks , the coefficient of restitution and ground motion properties. Free and restrained rocking blocks are considered. Then , static force-based approaches and performance-based techniques , mostly based on limit analysis theory , are presented to highlight the importance of investigating the evolution of the rocking mechanisms by means of pushover curves characterized by negative stiffness. From a dynamic perspective , a review of probabilistic approaches is also presented , evaluating the cumulative probability of exceedance of any response level by considering different earthquake time histories. Some recent simplified approaches based on the critical rocking response and the worst-case scenario are illustrated , as well. © 2017 by the authors.

In terms of altitude, much of the upper reaches of the valley stands over 1000 m above sea level. The natural environment comprises mainly semi-arid scrubland. During later prehistoric times, the Limarí Valley would have provided an important access route between the Pacific Ocean and communities occupying the valley (and its tributary valleys to the north and south). It is within the upper reaches of the valley that prehistoric rock art is located in a variety of locates including rock shelters and open-air sites. Many sites show that both painting and engraving techniques have been applied. This diverse media, along with changes in style, composition and subject matter reflects at two different chronological phases: hunter-gatherers and agrarian communities. In this short paper we compare the socio-ritual organisation of landscape among these two communities that at different times occupied this semi-arid area. Despite the aridity of this landscape, water appears to be the main focus for ritual activity among hunter-gatherers, especially within the secluded upland side valleys. Whilst hunter-gatherer rock art is associated with settlement, agrarian rock art relates to route-ways and the movement of people; here panels appear to act as markers within a transitional landscape. Fieldwork has revealed that hunter-gatherer rock art was usually placed close to flowing water, whilst agrarian rock art sites were located in isolated places, and with no apparent relationship with water. Both hunter-gatherer and agrarian communities are paradoxically contradicting each other in that hunter-gatherer rock art is metaphorically sedentary and agrarian rock art is fluid. Both regimes show how two different ways to engaged with arid places in the Southern Andean region; one related with water and the other with the movement of people and commodities. Both are key aspects to how communities utilised the same landscape, but in different ways and at different times. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Agrarian; Aridity; Chile; Hunter-gatherer; Landscape; Rock art","aridity; cultural tradition; historical geography; human settlement; landscape history; population migration; prehistoric; rock art; semiarid region; Andes; Chile; Chiles; Coquimbo; Limari Basin",2-s2.0-85009420556

The purpose of this work is to make a state-of-the-art contribution to the mechanisms involved in the process-structure-function relationships of cellulose-based hydrogels. The different assumptions that exist in the literature are reviewed taking the key role of the initial sample characteristics as well as the processing conditions into consideration. The decrease in swelling ability after drying is clearly due to an overall shrinkage of the structure of the material. At microscale, pore closure and cellulosic fibril aggregation are mentioned as the main reasons. The origins of such irreversible structural modifications take place at molecular level and is mainly explained by the establishment of a new balance of interactions between all components.

The results indicate that the seismic failure modes of RC columns can be categorized into flexure, shear and flexure-shear, but the failure mode of flexure-shear is difficult to judge precisely and often focused on by researchers in the seismic study and design. The shear effects on the seismic performance of shear-critical RC columns are mainly reflected in the plastic deformation stage, but the available methods for quantitative analysis of the shear effects are mainly depended on empirical models, and the generally accepted mechanical model for this problem is still need to study deeply.

Pennybacker's inspirational journey began with him aspiring to follow in the footsteps of the pioneering surgeon, Ephraim McDowell. It saw him cross the Atlantic, learn medicine at Edinburgh, train in neurology at Queen Square in London, and study neurosurgery under Sir Hugh Cairns in Oxford. Pennybacker navigated a successful career through World War II and together with Cairns established the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford as a highly esteemed neurosurgical unit. By increasing the operative tempo yet uncompromising the meticulousness of his operative technique, Pennybacker challenged the Halstedian and Cushing traditions. The pioneering Pennybacker system of managing cerebral abscesses stood the test of time and the ethos of preoperative imaging, intervention, and postoperative monitoring—clinically, biochemically, and with imaging results—remains today. Pennybacker contributed significantly to British neurosurgery and the training of both home-grown and international neurosurgeons and he was also a remarkably kind-hearted and calm individual.

The introduction of balloon angioplasty (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty [PTCA]) by Andreas Grüntzig in 1977 was perhaps the greatest incentive to the development of quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). QCA has played a crucial role in evaluating interventional techniques and assessing the results of new technologies. With the advent of drug-eluting stents (DES), QCA metrics such as late lumen loss and diameter stenosis (restenosis) proved to be instrumental in assessing new technologies. Refinements in QCA with the advent of dedicated bifurcation analysis and three-dimensional (3D) QCA have broadened the application of QCA. Beyond angiographic metrics, new developments in the field of QCA have introduced the functional component in the assessment of coronary lesions. Angiography-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR) may be a good tool for diagnosing ischaemia-producing lesions in patients with non-complex coronary artery disease. Furthermore, the incremental functional information can be used to expand the traditional late lumen loss (LLL) and restenosis concepts. © Europa Digital & Publishing 2017.

Although revascularisation has undoubtedly revolutionised the treatment of CAD, it is vital to understand the recent advances and importance of the concomitant use of evidence-based optimal medical therapy (OMT). In contemporary practice, OMT should include an antiplatelet agent (or dual antiplatelet therapy when indicated) and a lipid-lowering drug for all patients, and a beta-blocker and an ACE inhibitor (or angiotensin receptor blocker) for the vast majority of patients, along with addressing cardiac risk factors and lifestyle management. OMT is the recommended initial choice for patients with stable angina pectoris, and the indication for revascularisation would be persistence of symptoms despite OMT and/or improvement of prognosis. For patients with acute coronary syndromes or those who underwent coronary revascularisation with either PCI or CABG, long-term use of OMT improves clinical outcomes and prognosis. © Europa Digital & Publishing 2017.

The diagnosis is based on the presence of persistent fever and clinical features including exanthema, lymphadenopathy, conjunctival injection, and changes to the mucosae and extremities. Although the etiology remains unknown, the current consensus is that it is likely caused by an (infectious) trigger initiating an abnormal immune response in genetically predisposed children. Treatment consists of high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and is directed at preventing the development of CAA. Unfortunately, 10–20% of all patients fail to respond to IVIG and these children need additional anti-inflammatory treatment. Coronary artery lesions are diagnosed by echocardiography in the acute and subacute phases. Both absolute arterial diameters and z-scores, adjusted for height and weight, are used as criteria for CAA. Close monitoring of CAA is important as ischemic symptoms or myocardial infarction due to thrombosis or stenosis can occur. These complications are most likely to arise in the largest, so-called giant CAA. Apart from the presence of CAA, it is unclear whether KD causes an increased cardiovascular risk due to the vasculitis itself. Conclusion: Many aspects of KD remain unknown, although there is growing knowledge on the etiology, treatment, and development and classification of CAA. Since children with previous KD are entering adulthood, long-term follow-up is increasingly important.What is known:• Kawasaki disease (KD) is a pediatric vasculitis with coronary artery damage as its main complication.• Although KD approaches its 50th birthday since its first description, many aspects of the disease remain poorly understood.What is new:• In recent years, multiple genetic candidate pathways involved in KD have been identified, with recently promising information about the ITPKC pathway.• As increasing numbers of KD patients are reaching adulthood, increasing information is available about the long-term consequences of coronary artery damage and broader cardiovascular risk. © 2017, The Author(s).","Coronary artery aneurysms; Genetics; Intravenous immunoglobulins; Kawasaki disease","immunoglobulin G; behavior; cardiovascular risk; coronary artery aneurysm; diagnostic imaging; drug megadose; genetics; history; human; immune response; mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome; pathogenesis; priority journal; quality of life; Review",2-s2.0-85021296344

The column, ‘Psychoanalysis Will Help You,’ emerged during Juan Domingo Perón's first presidency, featuring verbal interpretations written under the pen name ‘Richard Rest,’ as well as surreal photomontages by Grete Stern, a German-born, Bauhaus-trained photographer living in exile since 1936. While the column's Jungian text encourages readers’ adaptation to the external reality of their social situation, Stern's droll images emphasize the disjuncture between subject and environment, exposing tensions between the experience of exile and the Peronist mission to consolidate an Argentine national identity. Experimenting formally with European avant-garde techniques, Stern presents femininity and nation as conflictive imaginary configurations. This theme resurfaces at the 2013 Venice Biennale, where Nicola Costantino's multimedia installation Eva – Argentina: A Contemporary Metaphor was exhibited alongside Carl Jung's Red Book. Formal contrasts between Stern's use of photomontage, Costantino's projection technique, and Jung's theory of mandala symbolism indicate the divergent ways in which their artwork posits the therapeutic function of the dream image, as well as the role of aesthetic production in psychoanalytic care.

We develop a strategy for identifying color systems where different populations stand out most distinctly, then we isolate those populations and examine them in other filters where their subpopulations also come to light. In this way, we have identified at least 15 subpopulations, each of which has a distinctive fiducial curve through our five-dimensional photometric space. We confirm the MSa to be split into two subcomponents, and find that both the bMS and the rMS are split into three subcomponents. Moreover, we have discovered two additional MS groups: the MSd (which has three subcomponents) shares similar properties with the bMS, and the MSe (which has four subcomponents) has properties more similar to those of the rMS. We examine the fiducial curves together and use synthetic spectra to infer relative heavy-element, light-element, and helium abundances for the populations. Our findings show that the stellar populations and star formation history of ω Cen are even more complex than inferred previously.

Methods: All obese women with a history of assisted reproductive technology (ART) failure that underwent ART treatment cycles both prior to and following bariatric surgery were included. ART outcomes were compared evaluating the duration and dose of gonadotrophins used; the measurement of day 3 FSH; the anti-mullerian hormone dosage; the number of follicles >15 mm; the number of retrieved and fertilized oocytes; the number of metaphase II, metaphase I and germinal vesicle oocytes; the number of embryos obtained; the number of top-quality oocytes and embryos; the number of transferred embryo; the pregnancy rate and the live birth rate. Results: Forty women were included. The total number of gonadotropin units required and in the length of stimulation following bariatric surgery decreased (p = .001), with an increase of the number of follicles ≥15 mm (p = .005), of retrieved oocytes (p = .004), of top-quality oocytes (p = .001) and metaphase II oocytes (p = .008).

Brito not only provided the first political and structural analysis of the Neo-concrete movement as a localized response to a transnational field of constructive practices, he advanced a model of critical art history that realigned theoretical production with ideological critique. © 2017 October Magazine, Ltd. and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,,2-s2.0-85029863961

The camera-integrated capsule allows for visualization of the small intestine, a region which was previously inaccessible to classical flexible endoscopy. As a diagnostic tool, it allows to localize the sources of bleedings in the middle part of the gastrointestinal tract and to identify diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease), polyposis syndrome, and tumors. The screening and diagnostic efficacy of the WCE, especially in the stomach region, is hampered by a variety of technical challenges like the lack of active capsular position and orientation control. Therapeutic functionality is absent in most commercial capsules, due to constraints in capsular volume and energy storage. The possibility of using body-exogenous magnetic fields to guide, orient, power, and operate the capsule and its mechanisms has led to increasing research in Magnetically Guided Capsule Endoscopy (MGCE). This work shortly reviews the history and state-of-art in WCE technology. It highlights the magnetic technologies for advancing diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities of WCE. Not restricting itself to the GI tract, the review further investigates the technological developments in magnetically guided microrobots that can navigate through the various air- and fluid-filled lumina and cavities in the body for minimally invasive medicine. © 2017 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","capsule endoscopy; magnetic guidance; magnetic microrobots; MGCE","capsule endoscope; capsule endoscopy; gastrointestinal tract; gastroscopy; human; intestine transit time; locomotion; magnetic field; magnetically guided capsule endoscopy; minimally invasive procedure; nonhuman; Review; robotics",2-s2.0-85021342342

Fifty-five women with a history of 3-7 years of infertility, with at least two assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment failures, and low serum levels of AMH were enrolled in the study. Before starting any further ART treatment, they were tested for AMH and for follicular count. A urinary control of BPA was proposed. Then a support of the 1-CC, already tested in other clinical studies, was initiated and continued for 4 months. At the end of this period, antral follicle count and serum AMH levels were re-evaluated. The AMH levels before and after treatment were compared using the Wilcoxon test (nonparametric test, non-Gaussian population). Out of the 55 patients, 35 accepted a BPA dosage in the urine.

Probabilistic caches were proposed to set bounds to Worst Case Execution Time (WCET) estimates and help designers improve real-time embedded system resource use. Static Probabilistic Timing Analysis (SPTA) for probabilistic caches is nevertheless difficult to perform, because cache accesses depend on execution history, and the computational complexity of SPTA makes it intractable for calculation as the number of accesses increases. In this paper, we explore and improve SPTA for caches with evict-on-miss random replacement policy using a state space modeling technique. A nonhomogeneous Markov model is employed for single-path programs in discrete-time fnite state space representation. To make this Markov model tractable, we limit the number of states and use an adaptive method for state modification. Experiments show that compared to the state-of-the-art methodology, the proposed adaptive Markov chain approach provides better results at the occurrence probability of 10-15: in terms of accuracy, the state-of-the-art SPTA results are more conservative, by 11% more on average.

If both musicians first appropriated the electronic medium for its possibilities in sound transformation, it appears that these experimentations, and more precisely those using feedback, quickly extended into areas other than research on tone and the live dimension of electronic performances. Indeed, electroacoustic feedback, as a phenomenon of retroaction, goes beyond the mere relationship to the instrument: by manifesting itself in the looping of the electroacoustic chain (microphone-amplification-speakers), it straightaway inscribes the electronic device in a spatial dimension that is linked to the propagation of sound. By analysing Neuhaus's and Lucier's first experiments with feedback, the specificities of their apparatuses and the experiences they aimed to create and foster, this article wishes to question the role these experiments played in the emergence of both musicians' concern with space, which is at the core of any understanding of their later works. We can then re-read their contribution to the history of live electronic music in the light of both bifurcations and lines of flight inherent in their respective bodies of work, in order to look into the emergence of a certain art of sound installation, in which the liveness of live electronic music, far from being pushed aside, seems to lead into other forms of creation and specific aesthetic questions. © 2017 Cambridge University Press.",,,2-s2.0-85023750242

The sparsity of user location interactions makes it difficult to learn travel preferences, because a user usually visits only a limited number of travel locations. Static topic models can be used to solve the sparsity problem by considering user travel topics. However, all travel histories of a user are regarded as one document drawn from a set of static topics, ignoring the evolving of topics and travel preferences. In this paper, we propose a dynamic topic model (DTM) and matrix factorization (MF)-based travel recommendation method. A DTM is used to obtain the temporally fine-grained topic distributions (i.e., implicit topic information) of users and locations. In addition, a large amount of explicit information is extracted from the metadata and visual contents of CCGPs, check-ins, and point of interest categories datasets. The information is used to obtain user-user and location-location similarity information, which is imposed as two regularization terms to constraint MF. The proposed method is evaluated on a publicly available Flickr dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can generate significantly superior recommendations compared to other state-of-the-art travel location recommendation studies. © 2017 IEEE.","Dynamic topic model (DTM); geotagged photo; travel recommendation","Factorization; Location; Temperature control; Dynamic topic models; Explicit information; geotagged photo; Matrix factorizations; Recommendation methods; Regularization terms; Similarity informations; travel recommendation; Matrix algebra",2-s2.0-85029211108

Life—the physical and biological basis of existence—is, in itself, bereft of culture and devoid of form. Through culture, however, the energies life harbors can become manifest. “We speak of culture,” Simmel writes, “whenever life produces certain forms in which it expresses and realizes itself; works of art, religions, sciences, technologies, laws, and innumerable others.” Life, in this way, produces something related to yet different from itself: “Life as such is formless, yet incessantly generates forms for itself.” Though form proceeds from life, conflict between them is unavoidable. Form struggles to liberate itself from the “pulse of life,” while life attempts to draw form back into its own “immediacy,” in a gambit to reduce culture's achievements to “direct manifestations of life.” The unprecedented character of modern culture, Simmel maintained, lies in the fact that life's forces were henceforth targeting the very “principle of form.” In the latest and most radical round of this conflict, life's cultural partisans assert that they no longer need the opaque and alien resources of form to express life's energies; form can be jettisoned, mediation dispensed with, and life can exist and relish its powers in their most unalloyed purity.

I firstly discuss this relationship, arguing that literature is not ethical per se, which is the reason why it can serve ethical purposes. Secondly, I state, in line with Martha Nussbaum, why any ethical thinking today has to refer to global ethics. Drawing from this, I present three recent novels, all of which deal with fundamental twentieth century atrocities: Burnt Shadows by Kamila Shamsie, The French Art of War by Alexis Jenni and The Walnut Mansion by Miljenko Jergović. They pose philosophical and ethical questions about war, violence and the great ruptures of civilisation. They are a component of world literature in the sense that the plot, and the ethical reflection triggered by this, is not related to a single nation state, but to the global situation. The authors make use of a historical profile encompassing a period of 60 to 100 years of narrated time. In this way, they can make a connection between personal and historical-political development visible. But this connection is less ensconced in the material history of the facts than in an ideology and ""culture"" that is responsible for the permanence of war and violent conflicts. The involvement of the characters in conflicts proves to be more than just a matter of character and of personal attitudes; it is also the result of social constellations. The personal and the political are never separated, which in no way releases the individuals from their responsibilities.","Aesthetic autonomy; Alexis; Jenni; Jergović; Kamila; Literature and ethics; Miljenko; Novel; Shamsie; Social engagement; Twenty-first century; World literature",,2-s2.0-85030563716

Using light as a probe for optical sensing is one of the most efficient approaches for this purpose. The history of optical sensing using some methods based on absorbance, emissive and florescence properties date back to the 16th century. The field of optical sensors evolved during the following centuries, but it did not achieve maturity until the demonstration of the first laser in 1960. The unique properties of laser light become particularly important in the case of laser-based sensors, whose operation is entirely based upon the direct detection of laser light itself, without relying on any additional mediating device. However, compared with freely propagating light beams, artificially engineered optical fields are in increasing demand for probing samples with very small sizes and/or weak light-matter interaction. Optical fiber sensors constitute a subarea of optical sensors in which fiber technologies are employed. Different types of specialty and photonic crystal fibers provide improved performance and novel sensing concepts. Actually, structurization with wavelength or subwavelength feature size appears as the most efficient way to enhance sensor sensitivity and its detection limit. This leads to the area of micro- and nano-engineered optical sensors. It is expected that the combination of better fabrication techniques and new physical effects may open new and fascinating opportunities in this area. This roadmap on optical sensors addresses different technologies and application areas of the field. Fourteen contributions authored by experts from both industry and academia provide insights into the current state-of-the-art and the challenges faced by researchers currently. Two sections of this paper provide an overview of laser-based and frequency comb-based sensors. Three sections address the area of optical fiber sensors, encompassing both conventional, specialty and photonic crystal fibers. Several other sections are dedicated to micro- and nano-engineered sensors, including whispering-gallery mode and plasmonic sensors. The uses of optical sensors in chemical, biological and biomedical areas are described in other sections. Different approaches required to satisfy applications at visible, infrared and THz spectral regions are also discussed.

In 1980, the PLA decided to focus its doctrine on positional defence. In 1986, the PLA introduced ‘integrated operations and prioritised strike’, a generalised doctrine that originated from its war history. Many organisational and intellectual challenges in peacetime doctrine development contributed to the PLA’s operational idealism, including its aging leadership, command structure, attitude towards its previous experience, limited analysis of contemporary military developments, and failure in test and validation of doctrines.

It is well-known that tree pruning strategies, such as alpha-beta, benefit strongly from proper move ordering, i.e., by searching the best element first. A wide range of techniques have been developed over the years to achieve good move ordering, and improved tree pruning, in the field, in general and in particular, in the alpha-beta search, have been extensively studied. Inspired by the formerly unrelated field of Adaptive Data Structures (ADSs), we had previously introduced the History-ADS technique, which employs an adaptive list to achieve effective and dynamic move ordering, in a domain independent fashion. Our previous results confirmed that it performs well in a very wide range of cases, and in varied types of board games. However, our previous work did not compare the performance of the History-ADS heuristic to any established move ordering strategy. In an attempt to address this problem, we present here a comparison to two well-known, acclaimed strategies, which operate on a similar philosophy to the History-ADS, namely, the History Heuristic, and the Killer Moves technique. We also introduce, in this work, a mechanism by which these established move ordering strategies can be approximated, or directly implemented, in terms of ADSs. We confirm that, in a wide range of two-player and multi-player games, at various points in the game’s progression, the History-ADS performs at least as well as these strategies, and, in fact, outperforms them in the majority of cases. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Adaptive Data Structures; Alpha-Beta search; History Heuristic; Killer Moves; Move ordering","Data structures; Forestry; Alpha-Beta searches; Competitive games; Domain independents; Killer Moves; Move ordering; Multiplayer games; State of the art; Tree pruning; Deceleration",2-s2.0-85026482238

Despite the proliferation of research on the mediatisation of education policy, few studies have explored the ways in which activists for public education engage with Web 2.0 technologies. This paper makes a contribution to this under-researched area by exploring selected activist accounts including Parents Across America, United Opt Out National, and the PS 2013 campaign in New York City. I draw on critical, feminist, and cultural studies theories of education and social movement media to analyse activist media practices in a policy and political milieu dominated by corporate media and neoliberal governance structures. The analysis reveals that progressive education activists strategically deploy digital media to amplify voice, build collective identity, and disseminate alternative knowledge to enable direct action. A situated analysis also reveals significant differences in activist media practice which are shaped by particular political histories and geographies. The paper concludes with a discussion about future lines of inquiry into the role of digital media in collective struggles for public education. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group","activist media; community organising; education policy; Social media; social movements",,2-s2.0-85026507866

METHODS:: We selected PWHA from our surveillance registry who died between 2007-2013, resided in NYC, and survived ≥15 months post-diagnosis to generate an HIV Mortality Reduction Continuum of Care (HMRCC) describing pre-death care patterns among PWHA. We used HIV laboratory test reports to measure care outcomes during an “intervenable period” (IP) during which deaths may have been avoided. The continuum was stratified by underlying cause of death (COD) (HIV-related vs. other), and the HIV-related HMRCC was stratified by demographic characteristics. RESULTS:: 11,187 analysis-eligible PWHA died during 2007-2013. 98% linked to care; 80% were retained in care during the IP; 66% were prescribed ART; 47% had VL≤1,500 copies/mL; 40% achieved viral suppression (VS). Half (47%) of deaths were HIV-related. Retention was higher among HIV-related COD (83% vs. 78%), but VS was lower (34% vs. 46%). The HIV-related HMRCC revealed disparities in VS. Despite comparable retention rates, Whites had the highest VS (42%, vs. 32% Blacks and 33% Latinos/Hispanics). Additionally, retention and VS increased with increasing age. People with a history of injection drug use had relatively high rates of retention (88%) and VS (37%). DISCUSSION:: The HMRCC is a novel framework for evaluating pre-death care patterns among PWHA and identifying opportunities to reduce preventable deaths. In NYC, reducing mortality will require increasing VS among those already in care, particularly for Blacks and Latinos/Hispanics. Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Using a qualitative content analysis and longitudinal data, we examine how ideologies about gender have been politicised in Afghanistan and are reflected in school textbooks from 1980 to 2010. Findings suggest that tumultuous political events and power struggles in the recent history of Afghanistan have led to many changes in how the daily social and working lives of Afghan women and girls have been portrayed in textbooks.

Next to the historical change, there is the anthropological duration with its baggage of immutable values that art brings to light. The merit of art is to focus not only on the biological aspects, but also on the social and emotional ones that define the mother/child relationship. The paintings that we have analyzed “speak” of care and caregiving, grief and suffering where maternity is experienced in solitude, in misery, in sickness. And it is to this latter aspect that we have drawn our attention. Most of the works are autobiographical or relate to events actually experienced by the artist.

A young poet who had moved to Rome from Romagna, Vincenzo Monti (1754–1828), obtained his first great success by celebrating the new discoveries in a memorable poem, La prosopopea di Pericle. In it, a newly found herm of Pericles sings of Pius's pontificate as a new golden age for the arts.

Several anti-angiogenic inhibitors are already registered for mCRC therapy: bevacizumab, aflibercept, ramucirumab, regorafenib. Nintedanib is a new triple angiokinase oral inhibitor that potently blocks the proangiogenic pathways mediated by VEGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR). Areas covered: The current state-of-the-art of anti-angiogenic inhibitors employed in the treatment mCRC patients, and in particular the role of nintedanib in this setting, is reviewed and discussed here. A structured search of bibliographic databases for peer-reviewed research literature and of main meetings using a focused review question was undertaken. Expert opinion: In first-line therapy, a phase II randomized trial showed that nintedanib plus chemotherapy was not inferior to the bevacizumab-based regimen. In heavily pretreated mCRC patients nintedanib improved some outcomes. During the natural history of mCRC resistances to anti-angiogenic therapies can set in and in this context, nintedanib, due to its triple inhibition, might play a role in compensatory angiogenesis overcoming the resistance developed due to VEGF directed therapy. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Aflibercept; angiogenesis; bevacizumab; colorectal cancer; mCRC; nintedanib; ramucirumab; regorafenib","aflibercept; bevacizumab; fibroblast growth factor receptor; nintedanib; placental growth factor; platelet derived growth factor receptor; ramucirumab; regorafenib; vasculotropin A; vasculotropin B; vasculotropin C; vasculotropin D; vasculotropin E; angiogenesis inhibitor; fibroblast growth factor receptor; FLT1 protein, human; indole derivative; nintedanib; platelet derived growth factor receptor; vasculotropin receptor 1; angiogenesis; antiangiogenic activity; antiangiogenic therapy; Article; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer patient; drug half life; drug metabolism; drug potency; drug safety; drug tolerability; enzyme inhibition; health care quality; human; metastatic colorectal cancer; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); antagonists and inhibitors; Colorectal Neoplasms; Neovascularization, Pathologic; pathology; randomized controlled trial (topic); treatment outcome; vascularization; Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Colorectal Neoplasms; Humans; Indoles; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor; Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor; Treatment Outcome; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1",2-s2.0-85021975639

In this work, we develop a SLAM framework that uses relative feature-to-feature measurements to exploit this structural property of SLAM. Relative feature measurements are used to pose a linear estimation problem for pose-to-pose orientation constraints. This is followed by solving an iterative non-linear on-manifold optimization problem to compute the maximum likelihood estimate for robot orientation given relative rotation constraints. Once the robot orientation is computed, we solve a linear problem for robot position and map estimation. Our approach reduces the computational complexity of non-linear optimization by posing a smaller optimization problem as compared to standard graph-based methods for feature-based SLAM. Further, empirical results show our method avoids catastrophic failures that arise in existing methods due to using odometery as an initial guess for non-linear optimization, while its accuracy degrades gracefully as sensor noise is increased. We demonstrate our method through extensive simulations and comparisons with an existing state-of-the-art solver. © 2017 IEEE.","graph-based SLAM; non-linear optimization; relative measurements; SLAM","Graphic methods; Iterative methods; Maximum likelihood; Maximum likelihood estimation; Nonlinear programming; Optimization; Problem solving; Robots; Extensive simulations; Graph-based; Linear least squares problems; Maximum likelihood estimate; Non-linear optimization; Orientation constraint; Relative measurement; SLAM; Robotics",2-s2.0-85027989662

Both wheel shimmy and vehicle body shimmy are self-excited oscillations of nonlinear systems, and they can be attributed to the positive work generated by the forces at the contact patch between the tires and ground. The continuation of the shimmy behavior is just maintained by the input energy to the system. Meanwhile, the wheel subsystem with elastic tires, the steering subsystem and the suspension subsystem are the three key sources where influences on the shimmy behavior come from.

Despite its long history, mechanism balancing theory continues to be developed and new approaches and solutions are constantly being reported. Hence, the balancing problems are of continued interest to researchers. Several laboratories around the world are very active in this area and new results are published regularly. In recent decades, new challenges have presented themselves, particularly, the balancing of robots for fast manipulation. Various design concepts and methods for balancing of robot manipulators are available in the literature. The author believes that this is an appropriate moment to present the state of the art of the studies devoted to balancing of robot manipulators and to summarize their research results. Thus, the aim of this paper is to propose a review of shaking force and shaking moment balancing methods used in robotics, in particular, for serial and parallel architectures.

We evaluated advancing age as a predictor of neurocognitive impairment in a large cohort of previously ART-naive individuals on long-term ART. Design: The AIDS Clinical Trials Group Longitudinal Linked Randomized Trials was a prospective cohort study of HIV-infected individuals originally enrolled in randomized ART trials. This analysis examined neurocognitive outcomes at least 2 years after ART initiation. Methods: All participants underwent annual neurocognitive testing consisting of Trail making A and B, the wechsler adult intelligence scale-revised Digit Symbol and Hopkins Verbal Learning Tests. Uni and multivariable repeated measures regression models evaluated factors associated with neurocognitive performance. Predictors at parent study entry (ART naive) included entry demographics, smoking, injection drug use, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C virus serostatus, history of stroke, ART regimen type, pre-ART nadir CD4 + cell count, and plasma viral load and as well as time-updated plasma viral load and CD4 + cell count. Results: The cohort comprised 3313 individuals with median pre-ART age of 38 years, 20% women; 36% Black, non-Hispanic; 22% Hispanic. Virologic suppression was maintained at 91% of follow-up visits. Neurocognitive performance improved with years of ART. After adjusting for the expected effects of age using norms from HIV-negative individuals, the odds of neurocognitive impairment at follow-up visits among the HIV infected increased by nearly 20% for each decade of advancing age. Conclusion: Despite continued virologic suppression and neurocognitive improvement in the cohort as a whole, older individuals were more likely to have neurocognitive impairment than younger individuals. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","aging; antiretroviral therapy; cognitive impairment; dementia; HIV; HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders","hepatitis B surface antigen; Human immunodeficiency virus proteinase inhibitor; nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; RNA directed DNA polymerase inhibitor; adult; age; aging; antiretroviral therapy; Article; Black person; Caucasian; CD4 lymphocyte count; cerebrovascular accident; cognition; cohort analysis; controlled study; demography; educational status; female; follow up; hepatitis B; hepatitis C; Hepatitis C virus; Hispanic; Hopkins verbal learning test; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; intravenous drug abuse; major clinical study; male; medical history; mental deterioration; mixed infection; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; trail making test; virus load; Wechsler adult intelligence scale",2-s2.0-85021725882

Design: Prospective study conducted between July 1996 and 30 April 2015. Methods: A total of 1748 patients (60% men) who did not have diabetes mellitus prior to ART were assessed twice a year. Incident diabetes mellitus was defined as either having two consecutive fasting glucose levels more than 126mg/dl, or reporting antidiabetes mellitus medication/diabetes mellitus diagnosis after starting cART. Incidence rates were calculated per 1000 person-year follow-up. Multivariate Cox regression was used to determine risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus. Results: During a median follow-up of 9 years (16274 person-year of follow-up), 123 patients developed new-onset diabetes mellitus, resulting in an incidence rate of 7.6 (95% confidence interval 6.3-9) per 1000 person-year of follow-up. From the multivariate models, age more than 35 years, male sex, BMI at least 25kg/m 2, family history of diabetes, abnormal waist circumference, lipodystrophy and exposure to didanosine were significantly associated with incident diabetes mellitus. The diabetes mellitus group had higher mortality rate (8.1 vs. 4.1%, P=0.04). A significantly higher proportion diabetes vs. nondiabetes patients developed cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications (8.9 vs. 3.6%, P=0.008) or chronic kidney disease stage III (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60ml/min/1.73m 2) (15.3 vs. 1.9%, P<0.001) over total follow-up. Conclusion: In addition to traditional risk factors, lipodystrophy and use of didanosine were strongly associated with development of incident diabetes.

This is of mutual importance, as studies of material culture can shed light on the rock art, while the iconography can be used to understand the contemporary material remains. A major challenge however, has been to determine the exact age of the images, as there are no direct dating materials. In order to overcome this challenge archaeological excavations and palynological analyses have been carried out at Vingen in Western Norway, one of Scandinavia's largest rock art areas. The archaeological and palynological data achieved, as well as loss-on-ignition are independent means for the dating of human activity. Since these methods provided similar results, an indirect connection to the rock art production activity may be inferred. Dates from archaeological contexts indicate a peak of activity between 6900 and 6300 cal. BP, with a potential start 7350 cal. BP and a culmination 6100 cal. BP. Palynological data from three different types of basins have documented forest disturbance in the same time period. Local vegetation reconstructions using the Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm has proved useful to identify anthropogenic-induced land cover changes in the Mesolithic period and a marked reforestation at the transition to the Neolithic period. The applied methods have helped to considerably improve our understanding of past activity and the environment, and demonstrates the potential of archaeological excavations and palynological studies for dating of rock art. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Archaeology; Data analysis; Dating of rock art; Holocene; Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm; Loss-on-ignition; Palaeogeography; Pollen analysis; Scandinavia","Data reduction; Excavation; Reforestation; Vegetation; Archaeology; Holocenes; Landscape reconstruction; Loss on ignition; Palaeogeography; Pollen analysis; Rock arts; Scandinavia; Rocks; algorithm; anthropogenic effect; archaeology; data acquisition; disturbance; human activity; iconography; land cover; material culture; Mesolithic; Neolithic; paleogeography; palynology; reforestation; rock art; vegetation history; Norway; Scandinavia",2-s2.0-85019921151

Music and law are considered as parallel social practices or performative doings. The paper begins with a critical analysis of the special aesthetical features of present-day juridical practice as exemplified by legal trial and legal expertise. Drawing upon reflections on the modern discourse on aesthetics and art, the article then examines in greater detail the specific traits of performance in law and jazz music. Performative processes move from representation to presentation, from a preoccupation with rules and controlling to induced self-programming. Both law and jazz regard the unknown future as a resource for present decisions by “inventing” new possibilities; both require, expand and promote a responsibility that does not follow from statutes nor can be expressed in a code of ethics. Finally, the article addresses the performance situation in jazz. Jazz being polyphonic and improvisational by nature, improvisation makes explicit tradition by staging the context dependency of its performance. It is mediated by the knowledge, the operational history and the communication of the participants. Jazz is an exercise in the possibilities of an “aesthetics of imperfection” which can open up new ways of seeing law and politics. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Cultural practice; Democratic governance; Judging; Learning; Modernity; Polyphony",,2-s2.0-85023754557

This concern is evident especially in developing countries where dietary and lifestyle risk factors associated with NCDs are becoming more prominent. This study explored the prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia and related risk factors in men and women living with HIV in Cambodia. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 510 adult people living with HIV randomly selected from one city and four provinces in Cambodia. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data on socio-demographic characteristics, health behaviors, medical history, and antiretroviral therapy (ART). Anthropometric and biological measurements were performed. Descriptive statistics were used to calculate proportions and means of the measured variables. An independent Student's t-test was used for continuous variables. Chi square test or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables to explore gender differences. Results: Prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia was 9.4, 15.1, and 33.7%, respectively. The prevalence of hyperlipidemia was significantly higher among men compared to women. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures were also significantly higher among men. Regarding risk factors, 17.3% of participants were overweight, and 4.1% were obese. Tobacco and alcohol use was common, particularly among men. Fruit and vegetable consumption was considerably low among both men and women. Physical activity levels were also low. About 40% of participants reported having a job that involved mostly sitting or standing; 46.3% reported engaging in moderate activities; and 11.8% reported engaging in vigorous activities during leisure time. A significantly higher proportion of men compared to women engaged in vigorous activities both at work and during leisure time. Conclusions: The prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia among men and women living with HIV in Cambodia is considerably high. Related risk factors were also common. Given the comorbidity of NCDs and HIV, policy and programmatic interventions are required, including integration of NCD screening into HIV programs. Distinctions in the levels of diseases and in health behaviors between men and women suggest that interventions need to be tailor-made and gender-specific, targeting their respective diseases and behaviors. © 2017 The Author(s).","Antiretroviral therapy (ART); Cambodia; Diabetes mellitus; HIV; Hypercholesterolemia; Hypertension; Non-communicable diseases (NCDs); People living with HIV","adult; alcohol; cross section; developing world; diabetes; disease; disease prevalence; disease treatment; female; food consumption; gender; health policy; health risk; health survey; human immunodeficiency virus; hypertension; male; physical activity; risk factor; socioeconomic conditions; adult; alcohol consumption; antiretroviral therapy; Article; body mass; Cambodian; comorbidity; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; eating habit; female; fruit; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; major clinical study; male; mean arterial pressure; non communicable disease; obesity; occupation; physical activity; prevalence; priority journal; random sample; recreation; sex ratio; tobacco use; vegetable; Cambodia; Nicotiana tabacum",2-s2.0-85024108627

Finding large samples of SNeIa and investigating their detailed characteristics have become an important issue in cosmology and astronomy. The current photometric supernova surveys produce vastly more candidates than can be followed up spectroscopically, highlighting the need for effective classification methods. Existing methods relied on a photometric approach that first measures the luminance of supernova candidates precisely and then fits the results to a parametric function of temporal changes in luminance. However, it inevitably requires multi-epoch observations and complex luminance measurements. In this work, we present a novel method for classifying SNeIa simply from single-epoch observation images without any complex measurements, by effectively integrating the state-of-the-art computer vision methodology into the standard photometric approach. Our method first builds a convolutional neural network for estimating the luminance of supernovae from telescope images, and then constructs another neural network for the classification, where the estimated luminances and observation dates are used as features for classification. Both of the neural networks are integrated into a single deep neural network to classify SNeIa directly from observation images. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method and reveal classification performance comparable to existing photometric methods with multi-epoch observations. © 2017 IEEE.","convolutional neural network; deep learning; image classification; redshift; Supernova","Atmospheric optics; Complex networks; Convolution; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Distributed computer systems; Image classification; Luminance; Neural networks; Photometry; Classification methods; Classification performance; Convolutional neural network; Expansion of the universe; Luminance measurements; Parametric functions; Photometric method; Red shift; Supernovae",2-s2.0-85027493531

In this paper, we propose Multi-Path D2D (MPD2D), a mathematical optimisation framework that accounts for the availability of D2D modes under flow demand requirements. MPD2D selects the combination of cellular and D2D links that fits better for boosting the network benefit. We consider the Underlay and Overlay as Inband D2D modes over cellular technology (LTE) and the Outband D2D mode exploiting WLAN technology (WiFi). Throughput, energy consumption, interference, and flow requirements are managed in order to maximise a network utility function accounting for cell capacity and power efficiency. We also derive a user satisfaction metric that accounts for the history of users within the cell. Integrating such a metric is lightweight yet very effective to drive towards almost complete fairness for the system over time. Our optimisation scheme is formulated as a Binary Non-Linear Program which results in very high performance in terms of throughput gain in comparison to other benchmarks for the D2D mode selection problem. Finally, we propose two effective heuristics whose performance and complexity we compare with optimal results and that largely outperform state of the art solutions. © 2017 IEEE.",,,2-s2.0-85027489274

Using Casey’s boundary/border discourse and Berleant’s aesthetic engagement theory, this article considers the impact of wind farms and large-scale landscape art installations on the landscape, and critically considers Scottish Natural Heritage wind farm siting guidance in light of the theoretical frames presented.

The Art of War summarises his lessons on how to solve the problems raised by conflict. The work comprises a series of pithy discussions of the different strategic situations that might arise, and the best responses for each. In many ways it is a masterclass in the application of critical thinking to practical affairs. Aspiring generals are advised to 'appraise the situation' according to five separate criteria, and to plan accordingly. 'The expert at battle seeks his victory from strategic advantage', Sun writes, so every general must assess their situation from every angle, and establish not only the best way to give themselves the strategic advantage - but also of preventing the other side from giving itself the advantage.

Numerous scholars in the fields of history and literature have explored the influence of crusading ideas, values, aspirations and anxieties in both the Latin States and Europe. However, there have been few studies dedicated to investigating how the crusading movement influenced and was reflected in medieval visual cultures. Written by scholars from around the world working in the domains of art history and history, the essays in this volume examine the ways in which ideas of crusading were realized in a broad variety of media (including manuscripts, cartography, sculpture, mural paintings, and metalwork). Arguing implicitly for recognition of the conceptual frameworks of crusades that transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries, the volume explores the pervasive influence and diverse expression of the crusading movement from the twelfth through the fifteenth centuries. © Elizabeth Lapina, April Jehan Morris, Susanna A.

Charmaine A. Nelson explores the central role of geography and its racialized representation as landscape art in imperial conquest. One could easily assume that nineteenth-century Montreal and Jamaica were worlds apart, but through her astute examination of marine landscape art, the author re-connects these two significant British island colonies, sites of colonial ports with profound economic and military value. Through an analysis of prints, illustrated travel books, and maps, the author exposes the fallacy of their disconnection, arguing instead that the separation of these colonies was a retroactive fabrication designed in part to rid Canada of its deeply colonial history as an integral part of Britain's global trading network which enriched the motherland through extensive trade in crops produced by enslaved workers on tropical plantations. The first study to explore James Hakewill's Jamaican landscapes and William Clark's Antiguan genre studies in depth, it also examines the Montreal landscapes of artists including Thomas Davies, Robert Sproule, George Heriot and James Duncan. Breaking new ground, Nelson reveals how gender and race mediated the aesthetic and scientific access of such - mainly white, male - artists. She analyzes this moment of deep political crisis for British slave owners (between the end of the slave trade in 1807 and complete abolition in 1833) who employed visual culture to imagine spaces free of conflict and to alleviate their pervasive anxiety about slave resistance. Nelson explores how vision and cartographic knowledge translated into authority, which allowed colonizers to 'civilize' the terrains of the so-called New World, while belying the oppression of slavery and indigenous displacement. © 2016 selection and editorial matter, Charmaine A.

As charity toward foundlings became a political priority, the patrons and supporters of foundling hospitals turned to visual culture to help them make their charitable work understandable to a wide audience. Focusing on four institutions in central Italy that possess significant surviving visual and archival material, Visual Cultures of Foundling Care in Renaissance Italy examines the discursive processes through which foundling care was identified, conceptualized, and promoted. The first book to consider the visual culture of foundling hospitals in Renaissance Italy, this study looks beyond the textual evidence to demonstrate that the institutional identities of foundling hospitals were articulated by means of a wide variety of visual forms, including book illumination, altarpieces, fresco cycles, institutional insignia, processional standards, prints, and reliquaries. The author draws on fields as diverse as art history, childhood studies, the history of charity, Renaissance studies, gender studies, sociology, and the history of religion to elucidate the pivotal role played by visual culture in framing and promoting the charitable succor of foundlings. © Diana Bullen Presciutti 2015.

The King's Two Bodies is at once a superb example of the critical thinking skill of evaluation - assessing huge quantities of evidence, both written and visual, and drawing sound comparative conclusions from it - and of creative thinking; the work connects art history, literature, legal records and historical documents together in innovative and revealing ways across more than 800 years of history. Kantorowicz's key conclusions (that history is at root about ideas, that these ideas power institutions, and that both are commonly expressed and understood through symbols) have had a profound impact on several different disciplines, and even underpin many works of popular fiction - not least The DaVinci Code.

One of the most important philosophical texts ever written, it is also a masterclass in the art of critical thinking - specifically when it comes to reasoning and interpretation. Descartes sought to do nothing less than create a new foundation for the pursuit of knowledge - whether philosophical, scientific, or theological. To that end, he laid out a systematic programme that reinterpreted prior definitions of knowledge, and reasoned out a systematic means of obtaining, verifying, and building on existing human knowledge. To this end, Descartes created a definition of true knowledge as that which is based on things which cannot be called into doubt by radical scepticism. If, he suggests, we can find a belief that cannot be called into doubt, this will provide a solid foundation upon which we can build systematic reasoning. This 'cartesian' method, as it has come to be known, is a blueprint for reasoning that continues to shape the study of philosophy today: a careful weighing of possibilities, searching out solid ground and building on it step by step. © 2017 by Macat International Ltd.",,,2-s2.0-85031429096

Based on the text of a talk given by Virginia Woolf at an all-female Cambridge college, Room considers the subject of 'women and fiction.' Woolf's approach is to ask why, in the early 20th century, literary history presented so few examples of canonically 'great' women writers. The common prejudices of the time suggested this was caused by (and proof of) women's creative and intellectual inferiority to men. Woolf argued instead that it was to do with a very simple fact: across the centuries, male-dominated society had systematically prevented women from having the educational opportunities, private spaces and economic independence to produce great art. At a time when 'art' was commonly considered to be a province of the mind that had no relation to economic circumstances, this was a novel proposal. More novel, though, was Woolf's manner of arguing and proving her contentions: through a fictional account of the limits placed on even the most privileged women in everyday existence. An impressive early example of cultural materialism, A Room of One's Own is an exemplary encapsulation of creative thinking. © All rights reserved.",,,2-s2.0-85032731229

Learning techniques are thus widely used to explore the dependence structure of the changing for population re-initialisation in the evolutionary search paradigm. The learning techniques are expected to discover some useful knowledge from history information, while the learned knowledge can help improve the search speed through good initialisation when change occurs. In this paper, we propose a new learning strategy based on the incorporation of mutual information, stable matching strategy and Newton's laws of motion. Mutual information is used to identify the relationship between previously found solutions; the stable matching strategy is used to associate previous found solutions bijectively and Newton's Laws of motion is applied to re-initialise the new population. Controlled experiments were carried out systematically on some widely used test problems.

Gombrich’s critical appraisal of Arnold Hauser’s book, The Social History of Art. Hauser’s Social History of Art was published in 1951, a year after Gombrich’s bestseller, The Story of Art. Although written in Britain for an English-speaking public, both books had their origins in the intellectual history of Central Europe: Gombrich was an Austrian art historian and Hauser was Hungarian. Gombrich’s critique, published in The Art Bulletin in 1953, attacked Hauser’s dialectical materialism and his sociological interpretation of art history. Borrowing arguments from Karl Popper’s critique of historicism, Gombrich described Hauser’s work as collectivist and deterministic, tendencies at odds with his own conception of art history. However, in his readiness to label Hauser a proponent of historical materialism, Gombrich failed to recognize Hauser’s own criticism of deterministic theories of art, especially formalism. This article investigates Gombrich’s reasons for rejecting Hauser’s sociology of art. It argues Gombrich used Hauser as an ideological counterpoint to his own version of art history, avowedly liberal and individualist in outlook. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Arnold Hauser; Art historiography; E.H.

He cited paintings by Jackson Pollock, the Lever Building, the 1954 Cadillac Cabrio, the roofscape of the Unité in Marseilles and photographs displayed in the Parallel of Life and Art exhibition as examples of contemporary ‘images’. This paper proposes to investigate the notion of ‘image’ propounded by Banham and to assess its importance, in particular for the architectural debate of its time. The first section explores how Reyner Banham undertook an operative re-interpretation of contemporary methodology in the fields of new art history and architectural theory (Panofsky, Wittkower), which used the term ‘image’ as an expression of ‘conceptual’ thinking. The second considers in detail how Banham applied the characteristics of these contemporary notions of ‘image’ (informal, topological, etc.) to architecture. The third and final section seeks to demonstrate that Banham's claim to a contemporary ‘image’ for the artistic and architectural production of his time, and the examples he cites to this end, cannot be subsumed merely as a desire for formal renewal but must be understood as the expression of a major conceptual shift in architectural theory, one that was profoundly influenced by scientific literature of the postwar period (Law Whyte, Waddington, Medawar, etc.). © 2008 The Journal of Architecture.",,,2-s2.0-85025651803

The poor state of conservation of the two portraits made any handling and exhibition impossible.

The information collected includes demographics, baseline and follow-up clinical data, laboratory data, medication history, drug toxicities, diagnoses and outcomes. Real-time data are captured during the patient encounter through an electronic medical record system that allowed transition to a paperless clinic in 2013. In addition, KIULARCO is associated with a biobank of cryopreserved plasma samples and cell pellets collected from all participants before and at different time-points during antiretroviral treatment. RESULTS: Up to the end of 2016, 12 185 PLWHIV have been seen at the CDCI; 9218 (76%) of whom have been enrolled into KIULARCO and 6965 (76%) of these have received ART from the clinic. Patients on ART attend at least every 3 months, with laboratory monitoring every 6 months. KIULARCO data have been used to generate relevant information regarding ART outcomes, opportunistic infections, non-AIDS comorbidities, prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, paediatric HIV, and mortality and retention in care. Requests for collaborations on analyses can be submitted to the KIULARCO scientific committee. CONCLUSIONS: KIULARCO provides a framework for improving the quality of care of people living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, to generate relevant information to evaluate ART programmes and to build local capacity to deal with HIV/AIDS. The comprehensiveness of the data collected, together with the biobank spanning over ten years has created a unique research platform in rural sub-Saharan Africa. © 2017, EMH Swiss Medical Publishers Ltd.

Repeated efforts to spark rich dialogue and collective interpretation around pieces of decorative art at The Frick Collection, specifically, has shown that, whereas painting and sculpture inspire responses that are not just formal in nature but also subjective and even phenomenological, clocks, commodes, porcelain and other such objects are seemingly less accessible, met with apparent discomfort, and confronted with the following questions: What was this used for? How was it made? How much did it cost? What is its provenance? Painting and sculpture, especially canonical examples of each, seem immune to this line of questioning and thus riper for dialogical engagement as defined by museum educators Rika Burnham and Elliott Kai-Kee. Without devaluing the importance of technical art history, functionality, materiality, and the history of collecting, I will explore how museum education–and the visitor experience broadly defined–is affected by the canon of art history’s hierarchical categorization of the fine and decorative arts. © 2017 Museum Education Roundtable.","canon; Decorative art; dialogue; fine art; Frick; museum",,2-s2.0-85025111109

They have been almost universally praised as providing a new and compelling image of war for those who have not experienced it themselves. We examine these portraits closely, arguing that they express a new post-modern ideology of “interpassivity”, allowing the spectator to exhibit signs of concern for soldiers, without actually doing anything to change their situation.

Where might music fit into this expanded conception? If ideas are defined purely as concepts that can be expressed in words, music can be no more than an “epiphenomenon”, a consequence or representation of ideas that lie behind it, but not capable of embodying those ideas in itself. Yet to many musicians, it seems obvious that music can function as a way in which ideas are developed and worked out. What kinds of knowledge might be embodied in music, then, and how do its meanings change over time? In this paper, I examine some of these issues through consideration of one of the key texts of Western art music, J.S. Bach’s St. Matthew Passion, exploring how it was conceived in a liturgical context in Bach’s time, how its meaning changed when transposed to the very different milieus of concert performance in nineteenth-century Berlin and colonial Sydney, and as it has been re-imagined in a variety of recent staged and recorded versions. © 2017 International Society for Intellectual History.","J.S.

Saura and his co-screenwriter used the French authors Théophile Gautier and Prosper Mérimée in their research on the period, thus incorporating views of Spain emanating from the culture of the Napoleonic aggressor. This, combined with the fact that the incorporation of outlaws into militia resistance was a common feature of the Napoleonic wars, produces a very complex backdrop for the film.

Since the Republic’s economic collapse in 2008 and the recession, museums have weathered significant shifts in governance and board structures, and drastic cutbacks that have affected programmes, staffing, and provision across the island. Yet, until recently we have not had an accurate picture of the “state of play” for Irish museums, hampering efforts to prioritise actions for museum support organisations, and preventing individual institutions to develop their own plans of advancement benchmarked against national data. Consequently, there has been a significant knowledge gap concerning the current state of Irish museums, stretching beyond the anecdotal, and bridging the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.

In the later eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries innovative visual approaches were developed that privileged the inspection and recording of material evidence where traces of historical alterations could be found. Such careful attention to historical sequence necessarily opposed an understanding of identity whose concentration on function and purpose transcended the vicissitudes of time. This visualization of the materiality of history was aided by three principal graphic devices: textual inscription, differentiated sequence, and notated palimpsest. Referring to Thomas Patch, William Stukeley, Giovanni Battista Piranesi, and John Carter, examples are provided of their records of alterations to works of art, monuments, and built structures. Their several approaches are located within broader discussions of temporality, memory, and change. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","antiquarianism; David Hume; Giovanni Battista Piranesi; John Carter; Thomas Patch; William Stukeley",,2-s2.0-85030451020

Our study takes a snapshot of this problem in Ghana. Although the country launched its antiretroviral therapy (ART) programme in 2003, progress toward realising the full benefit of ART for treated individuals has been limited, in part, because of stock-outs. In Ghana's Greater Accra region, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 40 women living with HIV (WLHIV) and 15 individuals with a history of HIV-related work in government or non-governmental organisations, or healthcare facilities. We used repeated review with coding and mapping techniques to analyse the transcripts and identify common themes. Stock-outs of ARVs result in inconsistent administration of therapy, increased indirect medical costs for WLHIV, and negative labelling of patients. Inefficiencies in drug supply, poor coordination with port authorities, inadequate government funding and dependence on international aid contribute to the stock-outs experienced in Ghana. Although using ARVs produced in-country could reduce supply problems, the domestically-manufactured product currently does not meet World Health Organization (WHO) standards. We recommend focused efforts to produce WHO standard ARVs in Ghana, and a review of current supply chain management to identify and mend pitfalls in the system. © 2017 NISC (Pty) Ltd.","antiretroviral therapy; healthcare funding; HIV/AIDS; pharmaceutical supply; reagent shortage; West Africa","anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; adult; antiretroviral therapy; clinical article; clinical assessment; drug industry; drug supply; employment; female; funding; Ghana; government; health care availability; health care cost; health care delivery; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; marriage; national health insurance; pharmacy; prescription; Review; semi structured interview; viral load testing; world health organization",2-s2.0-85030749122

Yet it can be demonstrated that there was a parallel Surrealist interpretation of the artist and, when contextualized within the evolution of Breton’s theoretical and critical writings over the same period, its essentially dialectical structure is revealed. © 2017, Taylor and Francis Ltd.

It argues that, in so doing, the city’s Parks and Cemeteries committee was attempting to refine the didactic space of the park as a site of civic memory. The early Victorian urban parks had sought to educate their visitors through their museums, art galleries and exhibition spaces, glasshouses and carefully planned and planted walkways. The insertion into this environment of part of a former civic building was intended to remind the visitors of their civic history and to warn surrounding districts of the expansionist tendencies of the city of Manchester. The failure to identify the façade or to connect it to its surroundings meant that its meaning was ultimately lost to many parks visitors and it remained in place as a civic folly. Public parks presented the municipal authorities with an opportunity to highlight the provision of recreation and leisure facilities, but also an occasion to re-invent the municipal tradition. However, as this paper shows, such gestures were often futile in the complex and contested space of the public park. © 2017 Society for Landscape Studies.","active citizens; civic memory; Heaton Park; Manchester City Council; Public parks; urban architecture; urban heritage",,2-s2.0-85032730929

The first is to resolve a concrete and long-standing problem that has challenged epigraphists and art historians. It involves establishing a plausible date for a five-line proverbial inscription carved in Old Venetian on the Treasury wall of San Marco in Venice. The inscription, often read and sometimes misread, has a lengthy critical history given its sensitive location in the great ceremonial passageway between St Mark’s Basilica and the Doge’s Palace, the nerve centres of Venetian religious and political power. It is also the focal point of an intriguing sculptural ensemble whose problematic dating is also at stake in the investigation. The critical disarray over the chronology of our public text is such that it has been assigned to various points between the twelfth and the fifteenth centuries. I attempt to clarify this chronological issue with detailed evidence drawn, in particular, from palaeography and linguistics. The second aim is to demonstrate, via a specific case study, the descriptive and predictive value of vernacular epigraphic philology as a critical tool in historical research when its interdisciplinary resources are systematically and conjointly exploited. The third objective is to provide an epigraphic contextualization for the enquiry. In this background survey I review the current state of play in Italian and Venetian medieval inscription studies, highlighting the discipline’s recent advances but also its reluctance to draw on the type of diachronic and comparative analysis of script and language exemplified in our case study. © 2017 The Society for Italian Studies.","epigraphy; inscriptions; linguistics; palaeography; Venice; vernacular",,2-s2.0-85021119871

I argue that these dealers worked within a series of overlapping networks. A primary network was centered in Munich, with dealers such as Dr. Bruno Lohse (Göring’s art agent in Paris during the war); Maria Almas Dietrich, Karl Haberstock, Walter Andreas Hofer, and Adolf Wüster. These individuals worked closely with colleagues in Austria, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein (states contiguous with Bavaria) in the postwar years. Many of the individuals in outer appendages of the networks had not been complicit in the Nazis’ plundering program, yet they trafficked in looted works and formed dealer networks that extended to Paris, London, and New York. Both the recently discovered Gurlitt cache – over 1400 pictures located in Munich, Salzburg, and Kornwestheim – and the annotated Weinmüller auction catalogues help illuminate aspects of these networks. Art dealers played a key role in the looting operations during the Third Reich and in the transfer of non-restituted objects in the postwar period.

It examines the mechanisms of US government policy for international heritage protection and suggests that domestic legislation of the 1990s protecting the heritage of Native Americans has played a significant role in changing museum attitudes and policies. The new transparency for indigenous artifacts has produced museum displays that address their ownership history, larger social context and the distinctly different values assigned them by various groups. For classical antiquities, in contrast, attention to aesthetics still trumps such vital contextual information. This article suggests a different approach, one that showcases the biography of the object, its various lives or contexts, and the way different stakeholders have valued it over time.

Specifically, it considers the influence of racial science on medical concepts of the relationship of bodies to climates. At their core, monogenesis-belief in a single, unified human race-and polygenesis- the belief that each race was created separately-were theories about the human body's connections to the natural world. As polygenesis became influential in Atlantic medical thought, physicians saw environmental treatments as a matter of matching bodies to their natural ecology. In the first decades of the nineteenth century, Atlantic physicians understood bodies and places as in constant states of flux. Through proper treatment, people and environments could suffer either degradation or improvement. Practitioners saw African Americans and whites as the same species with their differences being largely superficial and produced by climate. However, by the 1830s and 1840s medical students were learning that each race was inherently different and unalterable by time or temperature. In this paradigm, medical students articulated a vision of racial health rooted in organic relationships between bodies and climates. © The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press.

Howard, the protégé of a white Adventist physician, became active in civil rights during medical school. While serving as chief surgeon of the all-black hospital in Mississippi, he formed his own civil rights organization in 1951 and worked to solve the shootings of 2 of its members, George Lee and Gus Courts, and the murder of Emmett Till in 1955. His reports of these events and collaborations with other civil rights icons helped trigger the modern civil rights movement. At the same time, he became a nationally known proponent of abortion rights and then fled to Chicago in 1956, after arming his Delta mansion with long guns and a Thompson machine gun.

Despite great application of speckle pattern, its residual presence, for example, in interferometric approaches was considered as a noise, demanding filtering. However, grains themselves became information as their dynamic changes in time started to be linked to biological sample activity. Dynamic laser speckle has been since then a phenomenon widely used to monitor biological activities in many areas from agriculture to medicine. It is known as biospeckle laser (BSL) when adopted in biological material, with high sensitivity to follow very tiny movements in biological tissues, linked to changes in speckle provided by scatterer activities inside and outside cells. Since the 1970s, biospeckle laser usage follows a crescent technologic spiral where technological developments opened room for new applications, while new demands regarding biological monitoring forced the development of new methodologies. Therefore, potential adoption of the phenomenon as a sensor, for instance, in agricultural and medical processes, as well as constant offer of new devices provided new turns in the BSL technologic spiral and opened room for technique improvement. In this study, I present a short history of biospeckle laser (BSL) with applications and development associated with challenges regarding its usage in portable and accessible devices or even in commercial equipment.

SUMMARY ANSWER Total 5-year live birthrates were strongly influenced by female age and ranged from 80% in women under 35-26% in women ≥40 years, overall, 14% of couples conceived naturally and one-third of couples starting treatments with intrauterine insemination delivered from that treatment. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Few studies report success rates in fertility treatments across a couple's complete fertility treatment history, across clinics, evaluating live births after insemination, ART and natural conceptions. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION This register-based national cohort study from Denmark includes all women initiating fertility treatments in public and private clinics with homologous gametes in 2007-2010. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Women were identified in the Danish ART Registry and were cross-linked with the Medical Birth Registry to identify live births. Subfertile couples were followed 2 years (N = 19 884), 3 years (N = 14 445) and 5 years (N = 5165), or until their first live birth. Cumulative live birthrates were estimated 2, 3 and 5 years from the first treatment cycle, in all women, including drop-outs. Birthrates were stratified by type of first treatment (ART/IUI), mode of conception (ART/IUI/natural conception) and female age. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Within 5 years, in women aged <35 years (N = 3553), 35-39 years (N = 1156) and ≥40 years (N = 451), a total of 64%, 49% and 16% had a live birth due to treatment, respectively. Additionally, in women aged < 35 years, 35-39 years and ≥40 years, 16%, 11% and 10% delivered after natural conception, yielding total 5-year birthrates of 80%, 60% and 26%. In women starting treatments with IUI (N = 3028), 35% delivered after IUI within 5 years, 24% delivered after shift to ART treatments and 17% delivered after natural conception. Within 5 years from starting treatments with ART (N = 2137), 53% delivered after ART, 11% delivered after natural conception and 0.6% delivered after IUI. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION Birthrates are most likely higher compared to countries without national coverage of treatments and results are influenced by laws and regulations. Information on duration of infertility prior to treatment was not available. Future prospective intervention studies should focus on the role of expectant management.

In this letter, we take full advantage of matrix factorization and relative preference to make the recommendation model more scalable and flexible. In addition, we propose to take into consideration the concept of covisitation which captures the underlying relationships between items or users. To this end, we propose the algorithm Integrated Collaborative Filtering for Implicit Feedback incorporating Covisitation (ICFIF-C) to integrate matrix factorization and collaborative ranking incorporating the covisitation of users and items simultaneously to model recommendation with implicit feedback.

The aim is to obtain higher segmentation accuracy with less user annotation. Intuitively, we hope to annotate some frames to obtain better segmentation performance than to annotate other frames, which can be modeled by active learning framework. Specifically, we first generate a sample space of potential annotation regions via an object proposals method for each frame. Then, the annotation likelihood for the region is calculated in terms of annotation history and global consistency for the object in the video. Third, the segmentation result of the annotation region can be obtained by minimizing an MRF energy function. Fourth, the algorithm will provide the user with the most valuable frame to annotate, which has high annotation likelihood and large segmentation result change. Finally, the annotation is added to the framework to begin the next iteration. Experiments on a number of video sequences demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce the user effort and obtain the higher segmentation accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art methods. © 1999-2012 IEEE.","Energy minimization; global consistency; video object segmentation","Iterative methods; Motion compensation; Energy minimization; Global consistency; Query strategies; Segmentation accuracy; Segmentation performance; Segmentation results; State-of-the-art methods; Video-object segmentation; Structural frames",2-s2.0-85021323513

Methods: A retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database was performed. The characteristics of patients receiving ART as well as their current ART and their numbers of comorbidities and comedications at the censoring date (1 July 2013) were compared between patients ageing with HIV infection, patients who seroconverted while ageing, and younger patients. Results: We compared 10 318 ageing patients [median age 56 years; 25% interquartile range (IQR) 53–62 years] with 13 302 younger patients (median age 42 years; 25% IQR 36–47 years). The ageing patients were more frequently male than the younger patients (77 vs. 65%). Among the ageing patients, 7025 were diagnosed with HIV infection before 2000 and represented a distinct group, the ‘experienced ageing’ group, by comparison with the ‘recently diagnosed ageing’ group. Triple therapy containing a boosted protease inhibitor was used in 28.2% of the patients (vs. 39% and 36% of the younger and “recently diagnosed ageing” groups, respectively); a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor in 27% (vs. 33% and 38%, respectively), an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) in 9% (vs. 7% and 9%, respectively), and another regimen (fewer or more than three drugs) in 35.8% (vs. 21% and 16.5%, respectively). “Experienced ageing” patients typically had one or more comorbidities (62.1%) and were receiving at least one comedication (71%). Central nervous system (CNS) agents (prescribed in 44.6% of the “experienced ageing” patients) and antilipidaemics (in 44.2%) were the most frequently prescribed comedications. INSTIs were used in 23% of the population and were used significantly more often in patients with comorbidities and coprescriptions. For all comparisons, P < 0.0001. Conclusions: In ageing HIV-infected patients, especially those with a long history of HIV infection, comorbidities and coprescriptions are highly prevalent. © 2016 British HIV Association","ageing with HIV; comorbidity; drug−drug interactions; polypharmacy","antineoplastic agent; antivitamin K; cardiovascular agent; corticosteroid; fibric acid derivative; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; immunosuppressive agent; neuroleptic agent; nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; proteinase inhibitor; proton pump inhibitor; raltegravir; tuberculostatic agent; adult; aging; antiretroviral therapy; Article; cardiovascular disease; chemical interaction; combination drug therapy; comorbidity; controlled study; depression; diabetes mellitus; drug contraindication; drug interaction; dyslipidemia; female; France; hepatitis C; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; hypertension; kidney failure; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; middle aged; patient abandonment; patient history of therapy; prescription; priority journal; retrospective study; sexual dysfunction",2-s2.0-84990944989

Design Nationwide register-based cohort study. Setting Not applicable. Patient(s) In a cohort of 1,340,211 women who gave birth 1982–2012, we investigated the relationship between assisted reproductive technology (ART) and incidence of breast cancer. Associations between any ovarian stimulation since 2005 and breast cancer incidence were studied in a separate cohort of 1,877,140 women born 1960–92. Both cohorts were followed through 2012. Intervention(s) None. Main Outcome Measure(s) Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for breast cancer. Result(s) There was no increased risk of breast cancer in women who gave birth after ART compared with women who gave birth after spontaneous conception (adjusted HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74–0.95). The incidence of breast cancer was not increased among women who received controlled ovarian stimulation or among women who received other hormonal fertility treatments since 2005, regardless of live birth (adjusted HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.69–1.07; and adjusted HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.60–1.05, respectively).

About 5000 to 8000 distinct RDs have been identified, with an estimated 6% to 8% of people worldwide suffering from an RD. Approximately 75% of RDs affect children. Frequently, these conditions are heterogeneous; many are progressive. Regulatory incentives have increased orphan drug designations and approvals. Objective To develop emerging good practices for RD outcomes research addressing the challenges inherent in identifying, selecting, developing, adapting, and implementing patient-reported outcome (PRO) and observer-reported outcome (ObsRO) assessments for use in RD clinical trials. Good Practices for Outcomes Research This report outlines the challenges and potential solutions in determining clinical outcomes for RD trials. It follows the US Food and Drug Administration Roadmap to Patient-Focused Outcome Measurement in Clinical Trials. The Roadmap consists of three columns: 1) Understanding the Disease or Condition, 2) Conceptualizing Treatment Benefit, and 3) Selecting/Developing the Outcome Measure. Challenges in column 1 include factors such as incomplete natural history data and heterogeneity of disease presentation and patient experience. Solutions include using several information sources, for example, clinical experts and patient advocacy groups, to construct the condition's natural history and understand treatment patterns. Challenges in column 2 include understanding and measuring treatment benefit from the patient's perspective, especially given challenges in defining the context of use such as variations in age or disease severity/progression. Solutions include focusing on common symptoms across patient subgroups, identifying short-term outcomes, and using multiple types of COA instruments to measure the same constructs. Challenges in column 3 center around the small patient population and heterogeneity of the condition or study sample. Few disease-specific instruments for RDs exist. Strategies include adapting existing instruments developed for a similar condition or that contain symptoms of importance to the RD patient population, or using a generic instrument validated for the context of use. Conclusions This report provides state-of-the-art solutions to patient-reported outcome (PRO) and observer-reported outcome (ObsRO) assessments challenges in clinical trials of patients with RDs. These recommended solutions are both pragmatic and creative and posed with clear recognition of the global regulatory context used in RD clinical development programs. © 2017","clinical outcomes assessment; clinical trials; instrument development; rare diseases","age; Article; disease course; disease severity; history; human; interrater reliability; observer reported outcome; outcomes research; patient advocacy; patient-reported outcome; priority journal; qualitative research; rare disease; test retest reliability; treatment outcome; child; clinical trial (topic); food and drug administration; methodology; outcome assessment; procedures; Rare Diseases; United States; Child; Clinical Trials as Topic; Humans; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Rare Diseases; Research Design; United States; United States Food and Drug Administration",2-s2.0-85024405758

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has a deleterious effect on BMD, but its effect on bone fragility is not clear. The objective of this study is to analyze the BMD, microarchitecture, and tissue quality of bone in patients receiving long-term tenofovir- or abacavir-based ART. Design: We conducted a cross-sectional study in patients with HIV undergoing tenofovir or abacavir ART for more than 5 years. Methods: We measured BMD using dual X-ray absorptiometry,bone michroarchitecture using trabecular bone score (TBS), and bone tissue quality using microindentation. TBS is a dual X-ray absorptiometry-based software that is more highly correlated with bone fragility than BMD. Microindentation (BMSi) directly assesses bone quality at the tissue level. Results: A total of 63 patients were included in this study, with 36 belonging to the TDF-FTC group and 27 to the ABC-3TC group. Patients receiving TDF-FTC treatment showed lower BMD values than those in the ABC-3TC group. We found no differences in TBS or microindentation between the 2 groups. However, after adjusting for sex, age, body mass index, and 25[OH]vitD we found lower BMSi and thus poorer bone properties in the TDF-FTC group than in the ABC-3TC group [beta coefficient -3.594 (confidence interval: 95% -0.12 to -7.61); P = 0.043]. Conclusions: Long-term treatment with TDF-FTC leads to impaired bone health, not only in terms of BMD but also in terms of bone quality, another determinant of overall bone strength. To complement BMD-based predictions, these other techniques may also be used to identify patients with excess fracture risk. Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In the 1940s the uniqueness of the spermatozoa protein complex which stabilizes the DNA was discovered. In the fifties and sixties, the association between unstable chromatin structure and subfertility was investigated. In the seventies, the impact of induced DNA damage was investigated. In the 1980s the concept of sperm DNA fragmentation as related to infertility was introduced as well as the first DNA fragmentation test: the Sperm Chromatin Structure Assay (SCSA). The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick end labelling (TUNEL) test followed by others was introduced in the nineties. The association between DNA fragmentation in spermatozoa and pregnancy loss has been extensively investigated spurring the need for a therapeutic tool for these patients. This gave rise to an increased interest in the aetiology of DNA damage. The present decade continues within this research area. Some of the more novel methods recently submerging are sorting of cells with increased DNA fragmentation and hyaluronic acid (HA) binding techniques. The clinical value of these tests remains to be elucidated. In spite of half a century of research within the area, this analysis is not routinely implemented into the fertility clinics. The underlying causes are multiple. The abundance of methods has impeded the need for a clinical significant threshold. One of the most promising methods was commercialized in 2005 and has been reserved for larger licensed laboratories. Myriads of reviews and meta-analyses on studies using different assays for analysis of DNA fragmentation, different clinical Artificial Reproductive Treatments (ART), different definitions of successful ART outcome and small patient cohorts have been published. Although the area of DNA fragmentation in spermatozoa is highly relevant in the fertility clinics, the need for further studies focusing on standardization of the methods and clinical implementation persists. © 2017 The Authors.

Poets and philologists in Scandinavia turned to medieval manuscripts containing the remnants of the worldview of the Vikings (Ásatrú), and cultivated them as a repository of topoi and motifs for patriotic art. In this essay, I investigate how this positive reassessment of paganism tied into the national historiography of Iceland, and how it influenced the idea of an Icelandic ‘Golden Age’. For this purpose, the oeuvre of Jón Jónsson Aðils, Iceland's most prolific historian of the early twentieth century, will be scrutinised. This essay demonstrates how Aðils envisioned Ásatrú's role in the formation of Iceland's national character, and addresses the problem of reconciling a glorified pagan past with the nation's contemporary Christian identity. In so doing, it contributes to our understanding of the complex ways in which processes of national identity formation can affect and transform long-held ideas on religious and spiritual matters. © The author(s) 2017.

I argue that the rationalization of college admissions policies after World War II contributed to the rise of ‘‘meritocratic’’ stratification (in policy) and standardized tests, like the SAT, but it also led to the expansion and legitimation of the roles of student and school personhood in the admissions process. Schools more committed to enlarged conceptions of student personhood are more likely to adopt a test-optional policy, in order to recruit students who fit the distinctive characteristics of their school identity. To test the argument, I use a comprehensive data set of 1,640 colleges and universities in the United States and discrete-time event history models from 1987 to 2015. I also assess alternative arguments that emphasize economic or prestige-driven motives.

Methods In-depth interviews were conducted with 130 people living with HIV (PLHIV) who had initiated ART, 38 PLHIV who were lost to follow-up and 53 healthcare workers (HCWs) in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Malawi, Zimbabwe and South Africa. PLHIV were purposely selected to include a range of HIV treatment histories. Deductive and inductive analysis was guided by aspects of practice theory; retention in HIV care following ART initiation was the practice of interest. Results PLHIV who were engaged in HIV care took ART every day, attended clinic appointments and ate as well as possible. For PLHIV, biomedical markers acted as reassurance for their positive treatment progression. However, many described ART side effects ranging from dizziness to conditions severe enough to prevent them from leaving home or caring for themselves or others. In all settings, the primary concern of HCW was ensuring patients achieved viral suppression, with management of side effects seen as a lower priority. Where PLHIV tolerated side effects, they were deemed the lesser of two evils compared with their pre-ART illnesses. Participants who reported feeling well prior to starting ART were often less able to tolerate side effects, and in many cases these events triggered their disengagement from HIV care. Conclusions Retention in ART care is rarely an outcome of rational decision-making, but the consequence of bodily and relational experiences. Initiatives to improve retention should consider how bodily experiences of PLHIV relate to the rest of their lives and how this can be respected and supported by service providers to subsequently improve retention in care. © Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Despite level 1 evidence supporting the use of adjuvant radiation therapy (ART), <10% of men with adverse pathology (positive margins or T3 disease) receive ART in the USA. Early salvage radiation therapy (eSRT) at the time of biochemical recurrence has been proposed as an alternative strategy despite the lack of published randomized trials to support this approach. Multiple randomized trials are ongoing or recently completed to compare ART to eSRT, but given the long natural history of prostate cancer, long-term oncologic outcomes from these trials will not be reported for several years. In this review, we discuss the shifting trends in the diagnosis of high-risk prostate cancer given a decline in PSA screening, use of RP for high-risk disease, and compare and contrast the retrospective and randomized evidence regarding ART and SRT. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Adjuvant radiation; Prostate cancer; Prostate specific antigen (PSA) progression; Radiation therapy; Radical prostatectomy; Salvage radiation","docetaxel; prostate specific membrane antigen; adjuvant radiotherapy; antigen detection; cancer diagnosis; cancer radiotherapy; cancer risk; cancer screening; clinical trial (topic); comparative study; disease marker; high risk patient; hormonal therapy; human; male; molecular imaging; patient selection; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); postoperative care; prostate cancer; prostatectomy; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; salvage therapy",2-s2.0-85020931176

We tested the hypothesis that in heavily ARV-experienced patients in the Mexican ARV therapy (ART) roll-out program, the drop in ADR would be associated with changes in ARV drug usage. Genotypic resistance tests obtained from 974 HIV-infected patients with virological failure and at least 2 previously failed ARV regimens from throughout the country were analyzed for the presence of nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and protease inhibitor (PI) resistance-associated mutations (RAMs). Patients were divided into two groups according to their first ART start date: 488 patients initiated ART before mid-2003 (group 1) and 486 after mid-2003 (group 2). The rate of RAMs, median resistance score of several sentinel ARVs, and composition of ART drugs in patient's entire treatment history were compared between both groups. Patients in group 2 were less likely to have >3 thymidine analogue-associated mutations (TAMs) and >3 PI-mRAMs [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.37; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.25-0.54; p < .001 and aOR = 0.53; 95% CI = 0.36-0.77; p = .001, respectively] and had a significantly lower resistance score for zidovudine, tenofovir, ritonavir-boosted (r)-lopinavir, r-atazanavir, and r-darunavir than group 1 patients.

Reference disciplines for teaching NOS are disciplines, which reflect upon science, like philosophy of science, history of science, and sociology of science. The culture of these disciplines is characterized by controversy rather than unified textbook knowledge. There is common agreement among educators of the arts and humanities that controversies in the reference disciplines should be represented in education. To teach NOS means to adopt a reflexive perspective on science. Therefore, we suggest that controversies within and between the reference disciplines are relevant for NOS teaching and not only the NOS but about NOS should be taught, too. We address the objections that teaching about NOS is irrelevant for real life and too demanding for students. First, we argue that science-reflexive meta-discourses are relevant for students as future citizens because the discourses occur publicly in the context of sociopolitical disputes. Second, we argue that it is in fact necessary to reduce the complexity of the above-mentioned discourses and that this is indeed possible, as it has been done with other reflexive elements in science education. In analogy to the German construct Bewertungskompetenz (which means the competency to make informed ethical decisions in scientific contexts), we suggest epistemic competency as a goal for NOS teaching. In order to do so, science-reflexive controversies must be simplified and attitudes toward science must be considered. Discourse on the scientific status of potential pseudoscience may serve as an authentic and relevant context for teaching the controversial nature of reflexion on science. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,,2-s2.0-85028317621

Rather than following this established binary of possible subject positions, this article considers the unique biography of a filmmaker known in Indonesia as Dr Huyung. Prior work on Dr Huyung has either considered the pre and post 1945 stages of his life in isolation thus making incomplete assessments of his life and contributions. By bringing these two periods into conversation, a complete biography enables a more complex idea of colonial subjectivity to emerge. Huyung's life provides an alternative history of colonialism and an entry point in which to interrogate the limits and opportunities available in Asia of the 1930s to 1950s. This article traces the life of Dr Huyung from his birth in Korea as Hoe Yong, his life under Japanese occupation when he became Hinatsu Eitaro and moved to Japan to study film, to Indonesia as a Japanese propaganda officer, and finally to a new identity as Dr Huyung in independent Indonesia. As a trans-national subject operating across multiple subject positions - including colonial subject, colonial agent, and supporter of independence - this article challenges how subjectivity is thought about under colonialism and the historiography of national cinema in Indonesia, and contributes to understand his role in helping define and shape arts and culture in post-colonial Indonesia.

In locating the development of UK advertising within this history of commercial exchange, this article explores the modes of transmission and the material conduits through which innovations in advertising practice crossed the Atlantic. It also focuses on the role played by a distinctive 1960s formation of practitioners who used an organisation called the Design and Art Directors Association to champion the new idioms of US advertising. Their rise to influence helped to legitimate a new set of criteria for evaluating advertising which placed 'creativity' above 'research' and the 'science of selling' as the principal measure of good advertising. In exploring the exporting of the 'new advertising' to the United Kingdom, this article develops a particular understanding of how Anglo-American advertising relations worked to shape UK advertising practices. This foregrounds the way the US 'creative revolution', like other forms of US advertising, was adapted, hybridised and indigenised in its importing to Britain.

The probable geodynamical factors of induced seismicity are discussed. The detailed geophysical surveys, satellite geodetic data, and time history of the seismicity in the region reveal a complicated pattern of the structure and recent geodynamics of the region. The existing data suggest that the induced seismicity is here most likely to be caused by the regional (intraplate) stresses driving the displacements along the orthogonal network of the faults whose strength has dropped and continues decreasing due to the reservoir impoundment and operation processes. The evolution of the seismicity which started immediately after the rapid filling of the Koyna reservoir in the region of the dam, then rapidly expanded southwards and eventually became concentrated in the region of the subsequently constructed Warna reservoir shows that seismic events can be initiated by a number of factors whose contributions may vary with time. The key ones among them include reservoir loading and its seasonal variations; water saturation of the faults which guide the propagation of the front of fracture, increased permeability, and, probably, mineral transformations (hydrolysis) under the water level fluctuations in the reservoirs; and displacement of the front of the high pore pressure down to the main source zone of the earthquakes at a depth of 6–8 km.

A multitude of mucocutaneous diseases also occurs during the course of the ailment, with some conditions being classed as disease defining. They include infectious diseases and noninfective inflammatory and neoplastic dermatoses. With progressive fall in CD4 count, there is a change in the types of mucocutaneous lesions encountered. Aim: This study aims to statistically correlate the CD4 counts with the mucocutaneous manifestations in 100 HIV-positive patients. Materials and Methods: A total of 100 cases of HIV-positive patients with skin and mucous membrane manifestations were selected serially. A complete history was taken, clinical examination was done, and the CD4 count was noted. Patients were divided into four groups (Groups I, II, III, IV) with different ranges of CD4 values, namely, <50, 50-200, 201-500, >500, respectively. Results: The distribution of study population in CD4 ranges showed that majority (47%) of the study population had CD4 count between 201 and 500, and 29% of the study group had CD4 count between 50 and 200 cells. Almost 21% of the patients had the count > 500 cells and 3% had cell count < 50. Majority of the infectious and non-infectious dermatoses were common in the CD4 count between 201-500 (Group III) and 50-200 (Group II). In the study groups, 52 cases (52%) were on antiretroviral therapy (ART), and the remaining 48 cases (48%) were not on ART at the time of diagnosis of mucocutaneous manifestations. Out of 48 ART-naïve cases, 23 patients were screened and newly diagnosed at the outpatient department (OPD) based on the mucocutaneous manifestations. Most of the patients with multiple mucocutaneous conditions were in the CD4 count <200, whereas single manifestation was seen predominantly in CD4 count >200. Conclusion: Statistically significant association with the CD4 count was seen in herpes zoster ophthalmicus, genital wart, genital herpes, vaginal discharge syndrome, scabies, pyoderma, dermatophytosis, Hansen's disease, herpetic gingivostomatitis, seborrhoeic dermatitis, lichen planus, and drug reactions. These dermatoses may indicate the worsening of immune status and the need for regular monitoring with periodical CD4 counting. Occurrence of dermatoses such as photosensitive eczema, drug reaction, lichen planus, Type I lepra reaction, and herpes zoster ophthalmicus in patients on ART may be due to IRIS. To avoid the more frequent occurrence of infectious dermatoses and to reduce the development of IRIS with ART, all HIV-positive cases may be started on ART at higher CD4 count. Screening for HIV infection is suggested whenever the following conditions are seen: persistent oral candidiasis, atypical manifestations of zoster, herpes zoster ophthalmicus, herpetic gingivostomatitis and MC in adults, exaggerated IBA, and extensive seborrhoeic dermatitis. © 2017 Indian Journal of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and AIDS | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","CD4 count; HIV positive patients; immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome; mucocutaneous manifestations; prognostic markers",,2-s2.0-85032835545

The principle of the method was originally proposed in Japan and has been developed in cooperative works in the Society of Materials Science, Japan. The strain is determined from the whole Debye-Scherrer ring recorded on IP by single exposure of X-rays as a function of the orientation angle α. In one measurement, the normal stress is determined by cos α diagrams and the shear stress by sin α diagrams, without knowing the exact value of stress-free diffraction angle.

It is a city haunted by evil spirits from the past that actively shape the romance's plot. Rome's dark gardens, endless staircases, hidden corners and vast catacombs, as well as the malodorous Jewish ghetto, affect Donatello's and Miriam's judgment, almost forcing them to get rid of the Model, Miriam's persecutor. Hawthorne's narrator's shockingly violent, harsh and seemingly anti-Semitic description of the ghetto in Rome is just one among many similarly ruthless, and at times offensive, accounts of the city wherein Hawthorne situates his last completed romance, The Marble Faun. Hawthorne's two-year stay in Rome in 1858-59 sets the scene for his conception of The Marble Faun. In addition to providing Hawthorne with the extensive contact with art and artists that undoubtedly affected the choice of his protagonists (Kenyon, a sculptor; Hilda and Miriam, painters), Italy exposed Hawthorne to Jewish traditions and history, as well as to the life of Jews in the Roman ghetto. Most probably it also aroused his interest in some of the political affairs in which Italian Jews were involved in the 1840s and 50s. This historical background, especially the well-publicized abduction and conversion of a Jewish child, Edgardo Mortara, in 1858 provides important political and cultural background for Hawthorne's portrayal of Miriam in The Marble Faun. © 2017 Greenwald, Eliza.",,,2-s2.0-85026763739

In such a context, literature, which has always been closely related to politics, will inevitably move toward a new direction. This book is composed of two parts. Part One studies the development of literary theories in contemporary China from a Marxist perspective. It introduces the basic ideas of Marxist literary theories as well as their spread and development in China, such as the combination of the theories and Chinese revolutionary literature. Moreover, it discusses the challenges facing Marxist literary theories in the 21st century under the background of diversification of literature and art, in terms of theory and practice, and high technologies which brought about electronic writing and digital communication of literary works. The second part elucidates the author's insights into major issues concerning literary theories (e.g. the relationship between literature and people, literature and reality, perception and rationality in literary creation, etc.) This book will appeal to scholars and students of literary aesthetics and Chinese literary and cultural studies.

Countering a tendency in scholarship to overlook unsuccessful encounters, it starts from the assumption that failures can prove highly illuminating and provide valuable insights into both the specific shapes and limitations of East Asian and Western imaginations of the Other, as well as of the nature of East-West interaction. Interdisciplinary in outlook, this collection brings together the perspectives of sinology, Japanese and Korean studies, historical studies, literary studies, art history, religious studies, and performance studies. The subjects discussed are manifold and range from missionary accounts, travel reports, letters and trade documents to fictional texts as well as material objects (such as tea, chinaware, or nautical instruments) exchanged between East and West. In order to avoid a Eurocentric perspective, the collection balances approaches from the fields of English literature, Spanish studies, Neo-Latin studies, and art history with those of sinology, Japanese studies, and Korean studies. It includes an introduction mapping out the field of failures in early modern encounters between East Asia and Europe, as well as a theoretically minded essay on the lessons of failure and the ethics of cross-cultural understanding. © 2017 Ralf Hertel and Michael Keevak.

Instead, they have concentrated on the more recent internationally acclaimed art films, claiming that these constitute Iranian 'national' cinema, despite few Iranians having seen them. Film discourse, and even fan talk, have long attempted to marginalize the mainstream releases of the 1960s and 1970s with the moniker filmfarsi, ironically asserting that such popular favorites were culturally inauthentic. This book challenges the idea that filmfarsi is detached from the past and present of Iranians. Far from being escapist Hollywood fare merely translated into Persian, it claims that the better films of this supposed genre must be taken as both a subject of, and source for, modern Iranian history. It argues that they have an appeal that relies on their ability to rearticulate traditional courtly and religious ideas and forms to problematize in unexpectedly complex and sophisticated ways the modernist agenda that secular nationalist elites wished to impose on their viewers. Taken seriously, these films raise questions about standard treatments of Iran's modern history. By writing popular films into Iranian history, this book advocates both a fresh approach to the study of Iranian cinema, as well as a rethinking of the modernity/tradition binary that has organized the historiography of the recent past. It will appeal to those interested in Iranian cinema, Iranian history and culture, and, more broadly, readers dissatisfied with a dichotomous approach to modernity. © 2017 Pedram Partovi.

What does it mean to be human in the Anthropocene, or what is being called the new “Age of the Human,” with bodies that are inextricably interconnected with our physical world? These are the questions that Stacy Alaimo poses in Bodily Natures (2010). Six years later, literary critics, doctors, and environmentalists are still considering the powerful and pervasive material forces of toxins and pollution and their increasingly harmful effects on the human body. This topic was first introduced by Joni Adamson in a monograph that signaled a turn in ecocriticism to environmental justice that considered toxins and pollution in the places we live, work, and play (2001). Alaimo (2010), Linda Nash (2006) and others took up that new direction to reinforce the argument that the history of the environment is intertwined with the notion of disease and with the issues of social class, gender, and race. Drawing on the perspectives of elemental/material ecocriticism in relation to disease, the environment, and bodies, this essay explores Terry Tempest Williams’s Refuge: An Unnatural History of Family and Place (1991) to analyze how nuclear detonation, underground, was constitutive of the history of what she terms the “clan of the one-breasted women.” After emphasizing the possible (environmental) causes and risks of cancer or other chronic diseases in the age of the Anthropocene, the essay then focuses on attempts to uncover the “underground” or alternative epistemologies of cancer and other diseases and their associated therapies based on a reading of Victoria Sweet’s book God’s Hotel: A Doctor, a Hospital, and a Pilgrimage to the Heart of Medicine (2012). Sweet’s professional experience acquired over twenty years of practice as a doctor at Laguna Honda, a chronic care hospital, resonates with the perspectives of other authors who are also interested in alternative and ecological health care and in notions of “slow medicine,” “ecological medicine,” the art of gardening, and mind–body interactions. In the framework of elemental ecocriticism, this essay argues that in picturing an era of anthropogenic culture and confronting invisible xenobiotic chemicals, Sweet’s elemental ecocritical thinking of medicine, bodies, and environment is not obsolete but perhaps an “antidote” to the suicidal tendency of modern society. © 2017 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary","Cancer; Ecological medicine; Elemental ecocriticism; God’s Hotel; Refuge; Terry Tempest Williams; Victoria Sweet",,2-s2.0-85021271776

We start from the beginning, with a brief history of the program, and move into the construction of it as it exists today. We feel there are two items in particular that are of significant interest to the greater community. First there are unique problems that arise when the program is constructed (and expanded into satellite campuses). How to address these issues is of fundamental importance to any emergent FYE program. Also, the nature of flexibility among instructors is a topic frequently ignored by FYE programs and not significantly addressed in the literature-a topic among our program colloquially referred to as ""going rogue."" Within our program, we allow significant deviation to incorporate individual teaching styles while still requiring a core set of exercises to be accomplished by every course section. Starting in 2013, the Dean and Associate Dean for Academics in the College of Engineering visited established FYE programs and began planning implementation of a program suited to our own college. Improving student retention was the primary goal and the secondary goal was to reduce changes of major within the college to help students choose an appropriate major and pursue it to graduation. This phenomenon is not endemic to our program and has been documented by others (Froyd & Ohland, 2005) Initial discussions with a working group explored what course changes would be necessary to develop an introductory curriculum acceptable to all nine degree programs. In 2015, a director was appointed from within the college with 50% effort assigned to administering the program. With the help of department representatives, a three-course sequence was envisioned to replace the discipline specific ""101"" courses, either of two computer programming courses and the general education requirement for Inquiry into Arts & Creativity. All students must be in pre-calculus or beyond to be admitted to the college. The balance of credit hours and course enrollments over the first two semesters requires that some students take chemistry first and others take physics first with or without the labs. The course outlines were approved and all of the degree program curricula were changed in one combined proposal. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.",,"Calculations; Computer programming; Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Teaching; Computer programming course; Construction of it; Course sequences; First-year engineering; First-year engineering programs; General education; Student retention; Work in progress; Students",2-s2.0-85030543568

The SfT initiative is designed to utilize a science-based curriculum to provide urban youth in Chicago with information and skills related to science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) careers and foster positive attitudes toward STEAM subjects and related careers. This grant financially sustained SfT and allowed it to serve 15 out-of-school-time organizations for two years. Today, the SfT initiative is in its sixth year, serving more than 40 out-of-school time organizations, 600 middle school student and 150 parents per semester in a self-sustained mode. The Scientists for Tomorrow initiative is a partnership between postsecondary institutions, out-of-school time organizations and informal-science education providers. The initiative is implemented throughout communities during the academic school year exploring different learning module, such as ""Alternative Energies,"" ""Physics of Sound and Mathematics of Music,""""People and Plants,""""Robotics"" and ""Astronomy"". Before each module starts, the SfT initiative provides more than 15 hours of professional development for all of the instructors involved in the program. Each session includes 10 weekly, 90-minute classes exploring the modules, as well as a Family Science Day field trip, where participating students and their families are invited to one of SfT's partner institutions, including the Museum of Science and Industry, The Field Museum of Natural History and the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum. The question the SfT initiative explores is if there are changes in participants' and out-ofschool time organization leadership's attitude towards STEAM, as well as a gain in content knowledge. To study this question, participants are given a survey gaging their attitudes and knowledge about STEAM before and after each module. Additionally, all instructors are required to complete Activity Journal Logs after each of their class sessions. These journals allow instructors to reflect on their classes and help to identify where they needed more support from the SfT initiative. Finally, the out-of-school-time organization's director, program coordinators and volunteers are given a survey to evaluate the program as a whole at the end of each module. Four years of external evaluation show that the SfT initiative cultivates a modest gain in content knowledge and an increase in positive attitudes towards STEAM. The findings also show a significant, positive change of attitude from out-of-schooltime organizations' leadership toward the introduction of STEAM academic enrichment activities as part of the regular activities in their out-of-school-time programs. As the Scientists for Tomorrow initiative has grown, some of the lessons learned include 1) the need to have more parental involvement in the SfT initiative's activities to ensure success, 2) the need to provide instructors with flexible professional development opportunities and feedback conversations to ensure the quality of the learning process remains high and the growth of the out-of-school-time organizations' capacity to continue promoting STEAM as an integral part of their out-of-school-time model, and 3) the need to promote the public perception that out-of-school-time learning is as important as formal education in helping academically advance students, especially those in underserved communities. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.",,"Education; Education computing; Engineering education; Museums; Professional aspects; Societies and institutions; Steam; Students; Surveys; Community-based organizations; Informal science education; Middle school students; National Science Foundations; Parental involvements; Post-secondary institutions; Professional development; Professional development opportunities; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)",2-s2.0-85030543342

In her memoir Farm City: The Education of an Urban Farmer (2009), Carpenter’s story of small family farming, indeed, evokes what Eric T. Freyfogle describes as an agrarian mode of life in which humans, as members of the land community, are “just as dependent as other life on the land’s fertility and just as shaped by its mysteries and possibilities” (Freyfogle, in: Freyfogle (ed) The new agrarianism: land, culture, and the community of life, Island Press, Washington, DC, 2001, p. xiii). Carpenter’s return to the city, however, marks a critical break from traditional understandings of agrarianism, challenging the city-country binary that has long been employed in the imagining of agrarianism. Farming in the city, like traditional agrarians she is attentive to the agencies of nonhuman entities and matters; unlike them, she moves beyond their rurality to reconfigure cities as agential bodies constantly in dynamic processes of becoming. In Farm City, her return from the land shifts the emphasis from the countryside to the city, evoking a “new agrarianism” that foregrounds both environmental stewardship and community-citizenship. The urban strain of Carpenter’s farming experience, I argue, not only brings to the fore the agronomic and spiritual potentialities of inner cities but forges a new ethical relation embracing humanity and history as active agents of the agrarian community. © 2017 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary","Agrarianism; Back-to-the-land movement; Farm City; Food literature; Novella Carpenter; Urban farming",,2-s2.0-85021093365

By contrast, artistic conceptions of the images of the body tend to focus on interpretative heterogeneity and ambiguity, aiming to create or explore meaning rather than enact a particular function. In her 2015 retrospective exhibition at the Tate Modern, South African artist Marlene Dumas questions these disciplinary divides by using medical imagery (among other photographic sources) as the basis for her portraits. Her portrait 'The White Disease' draws on an unidentified photograph taken from a medical journal, but obscures the original image to such a degree that any representation of a particular disease is highly questionable. The title creates a new classification, which reflects on disease and on the racial politics of South Africa during apartheid. Though, on the one hand, these techniques are seemingly disparate from the methods of medical understanding, features such as reliance on classification, and attempts at dispelling ambiguity, bring Dumas' work closer to the history of dermatological portraits than would usually be perceived to be the case. In considering the continuities and disparities between conceptualisations of skin in dermatology and Dumas' art, this paper questions assumptions of photographic objectivity to suggest that there is greater complexity and interpretative scope in medical dermatological images than might initially be assumed. © Article author (or their employer) 2017.",,,2-s2.0-85027558209

The problem is expected to become more severe in future DRAMs mostly due to increased inter-row coupling at advanced technology. In order to address this problem, we present a probabilistically managed table (called PRoHIT) implemented on the DRAM chip. The table keeps track of victim row candidates in a probabilistic way and, in case of auto-refresh, the topmost entry is additionally refreshed thereby mitigating the row hammering problem. Our experiments with PARSEC benchmark and synthetic traces show that PRoHIT outperforms the state-of-The-Art method, PARA, by 35.7% (PARSEC) in terms of the reduction ratio of row-hammer cases. Our proposed method also shows constantly superior performance to PARA for synthetic traces. © 2017 ACM.","aggressor row; DRAM; history-based; Row hammering; victim row","Automation; Design; Dynamic random access storage; Advanced technology; aggressor row; DRAM chips; Reduction ratios; Row hammering; State-of-the-art methods; victim row; Computer aided design",2-s2.0-85023594788

The current paper presents an SfM strategy that orders the different views/images of the scene in the reconstruction process according to a processing age metric, i.e., a metric parameterizing the amount of processing stages operated on each image.

As such, analytical imaging has emerged as an important approach for the study of cultural heritage. Imaging technologies commonly employed, from the macroscale through the micro- to nanoscale, are discussed with respect to how the information obtained helps us understand artists' materials and methods, the cultures in which the objects were created, how the objects may have changed over time, and importantly, how we may develop strategies for their preservation. © 2017 by Annual Reviews.","Conservation science; Cultural heritage; Multiscale; Noninvasive analysis; Spectroscopic imaging; Technical art history","History; Imaging techniques; Spectroscopic analysis; Art history; Conservation science; Cultural heritages; Multiscale; Noninvasive analysis; Spectroscopic imaging; Historic preservation",2-s2.0-85020697184

Due to limited connectivity, DTN is vulnerable to flooding attack in which malicious nodes flood the network with superfluous data to deplete the network resources. Existing works mitigate internal flooding attacks by rate-limit to constrain the number of messages that nodes can generate per time slot. However, rate-limit cannot flexibly accommodate burst traffic in which nodes may have sending demand higher than the rate-limit for a short period. In this paper, we propose FDER to detect flooding attack and yet allow legitimate burst traffic simultaneously. Nodes exchange their histories of encounter records (ER) which record the sent messages during their previous encounters. The ER history is used to infer a node's new message transmission rate over time and the number of forwarded replicas per message. Nodes which send too many messages or replicas can thus be detected. Since ER serves as a useful tool for monitoring nodes' sending behavior over a long time period, FDER could detect the burst traffic violation efficiently. Simulation results show that FDER can detect flooding attack at higher accuracy and lower delay compared to state-of-the-art scheme. © 2017 IEEE.","DTN; Encounter record; Flooding attack","Floods; Routers; Wireless networks; Encounter record; Flooding attacks; Intermittent connectivity; Malicious nodes; Message transmissions; Moni-toring nodes; Network resource; State-of-the-art scheme; Delay tolerant networks",2-s2.0-85021770409

CubeSats attempted to choose a different philosophy, utilizing suitable state-of the art, commercial-off-the shelf products, yielding, if successful, an increased performance per mass figure of merit for those small vessels at potentially higher risk but lower cost. CubeSats seemed to promise universities and companies to be faster, better and cheaper - once more in history. Unfortunately, many CubeSat missions, especially university-built ones, never achieved a detectable functional state or failed shortly after the satellites were ejected from their deployer. Data based on our developed CubeSat Failure Database (CFD) and research carried out by others suggest, that a great percentage of those early failure cases could have been detected and avoided by more careful and adequate system-level functional testing on the ground. However, many university teams still fail to plan with adequate resources for system level functional testing or are confronted with hard deadlines, thus unable to complete appropriate integrated system testing on a sufficient level, and launching a satellite that never was adequately functional. Ongoing work on a novel reliability estimation tool using Bayesian methods is introduced to fill this gap and to provide meaningful data for all developers on the achievable reliability and required functional testing time of their CubeSats. Using test data and reliability goals for their actual mission, merging that data with statistical data from past missions and a database of subjective developer's beliefs, CubeSat developers should now be able to estimate their required functional testing time on subsystem and system level at an early project stage, as a function of the targeted reliability goal for their CubeSat. Alternatively, if the required resources (testing time, money, knowledge) are not available, CubeSat developers and program managers can still use the tool to now quantify a resulting realistic lower boundary for the expected system reliability of the mission, and decide, if their mission goals can be fulfilled or not with a certain probability. To evolve CubeSats into more reliable and accepted platforms for scientific payloads and commercial applications, it is utmost important to avoid or reduce the many infant mortality cases, where no or little useful data is produced by the satellite. To guide developers towards higher success rates without losing the spirit of using novel, state of the art technology in fast mission timelines, the reliability estimation tool should ensure higher reliability of CubeSat missions without drawing too much resources nor imposing too many burdens on the CubeSat teams. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Bayesian networks; Integrated control; Satellites; Software testing; Statistical tests; Subjective testing; Commercial applications; Commercial off-the-shelf products; Conservative designs; Integrated system testing; Performance testing; Reliability estimation; Scientific payloads; State-of-the-art technology; Reliability",2-s2.0-85021231385

The study format was an email survey. All participants were current or former baccalaureate students who had taken one or more courses in literature and narrative in medicine, bioethics, history of medicine, and/or visual arts and healthcare during the past four years. The survey gathered numerical data in several areas: demographic information, career plans, self-reported influence of coursework on educational and career plans, and self-reported influence of coursework on intellectual skills and abilities. It also gathered narrative commentary that elaborated on students’ responses to the numerically-based questions. Notable findings from preliminary analysis of the data include higher scores of self-reported impact of the coursework on specific habits of mind and on preparedness for intended career rather than on gaining admission to future educational programs.

These will be demonstrated on currently funded missions, such as INSPIRE, MarCO, and Lunar Flashlight, which will be among the first CubeSat missions to leave Earth's orbit and explore deep space, Mars, and the Moon, respectively. Other concepts may consider using these technologies to explore Venus, asteroids, Europa, Titan, and other areas of the solar system. These missions and concepts can be enabled by the development of miniaturized yet performant command and data handling, power, software, and communications systems specifically designed for deep space applications. JPL is pushing the state of the art in small subsystems to augment NASA's history of exploration. While the CubeSat/SmallSat component market has grown significantly to benefit LEO applications, only a few vendors are actively developing avionics and instrument interface electronics capable of meeting the stringent environmental, reliability, and performance requirements of deep space missions. These electronics and systems need to be specifically designed to handle harsh radiation and thermal environments as well as extended mission durations, where a CubeSat may begin its science observations after a multi-year cruise. Deep space missions also require additional technologies, such as radio transponders for interplanetary navigation. This paper first summarizes the systems-level developments of the enabling technologies of the JPL avionics bus, looking at maturing hardware and as well as future evolutions of technologies. Second, the paper discusses potential science instruments and applications that could be accommodated by these unique flight systems, either within a CubeSat or SmallSat form factor.

The events of the 1st Russian Revolution, having demonstrated folk power, made intelligentsia change their attitude toward the folk. Folk ideas had been present at artwork of intelligentsia before, and a new twist and form of artistic expression was added later. Addressing folk theme, according to intelligentsia opinion, would help them to understand the folk soul and solve the problem of interactions between intelligentsia and the folk. Intelligentsia considered the history of Russia and the history of its folk as a whole, that is why addressing the past dominated in subjects of intelligentsia artwork. Attempts to develop a deeper understanding of folk world perception made intelligentsia pay more attention to folk art. Depending on their appreciation of art and aesthetic preferences, artists payed their attention to the things, that formed the basis of folk art: folklore, frescoes, icons, lubok. The processes, taking place in Russian artistic life, reflected in Siberian artistic intelligentsia works. Siberian intelligentsia, being in most cases first-generation, were less disconnected from folk, if compared with the intelligentsia, living in the central part of Russia. They saw devotion to the folk as their primary mission, and the folk were the main inspiration source for their artwork. The article describes the way the folk theme is presented in the artwork of greatest representatives of artistic intelligentsia, substantiates the role of the artwork and its significance for the development of culture in general, and shows its incapability to be widely understood by the folk.

I will ask if body techniques can facilitate the public’s understanding of the abstract engineering sciences exhibited in a science and technology museum. Using the ethnographic study of this performance, I will ask if this new type of museum mediation opens up new research issues about technical gestures and helps us to blur boundaries between tangible and intangible heritage in the museum context. In doing so I try to redeploy the methods of analysis of museum collections and to contribute to the theoretical and methodological renewal of the history of technology. I show that this new way to mediate science and technology museum collections using body techniques and gestures produces a methodological indistinctness between intentionality and contingency that often marks the epistemological break between art, technology and science in western culture. This anthropological way of looking at museums of science and technology opens up new research issues not only for the museum’s scientific and technical heritage but also for the history of science and techniques. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","acrobatics; body techniques; bridge; gesture; intangible heritage; museum",,2-s2.0-85018761193

Specifically, the music of Mozart with its “Mozart effect” is appropriate to use in neurosurgery. We investigated the relationship between Mozart's music and neurosurgery. Material and Methods We used digital catalogs like “PubMed” and the libraries of universities. Key words were “Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart” and “neurosurgery and music.” Results In the first half of the 20th century, performing neurosurgery on some musicians, such as Maurice Ravel, Josef Hassid, and George Gershwin, resulted in a fatal outcome. The cause of this is probably that neurosurgery had not been developed yet in the first half of the 20th century. In the past 3 decades, the neurosurgical operations of musicians show that musicians have rich associations among auditory, somatic, and sensorial systems. Conclusion It is clear that we have much to learn from studies about music and brain function that derive from our surgical experiences with patients. The neuronal plasticity of musicians' brains may be different from that of nonmusicians' brains. Musicians with enhanced motor skills have greater capacity for plasticity because of enriched interhemispheric connections. Listening to music and the effect of Mozart in neurosurgical practice, intensive care, or rehabilitation were documented in many studies. As authors, we mean something different: Its effectiveness should be studied. We concluded that in current neurosurgical practice, Mozart has an effect. More research and clinical studies are needed. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Chronic epidural hematoma; History of neurosurgery; Musician; Skull fracture; Traumatic brain injury","Article; human; music; musician; neurosurgery; art; brain; factual database; hearing; history; male; neurosurgery; physiology; public figure; statistics and numerical data; surgery; Auditory Perception; Brain; Databases, Factual; Famous Persons; History, 18th Century; History, 20th Century; Humans; Male; Music; Neurosurgery",2-s2.0-85017338329

However, a growth in the interest in public history and in the history of mental healthcare has offered new opportunities for those in the humanities to engage new audiences and to challenge perceptions about care in the past. The introduction of the ‘impact agenda’ and related funding streams has further encouraged academics to contribute to historical debates, and to those concerning current services. One such example of this is the Arts and Humanities Research Council funded Heritage and Stigma project at the University of Huddersfield, which was conceived to support mental health and learning disability charities in the exploration and dissemination of their own histories. Using this project as a case study, this paper will draw on primary source material to reflect on the opportunities and challenges of working in partnership with such groups. In particular, it will consider the need to address issues of stigma and exclusion in tandem with a critical understanding of the moves to ‘community care’ instigated by landmark legislation in the form of the 1959 Mental Health Act. Overall, it provides evidence of an inclusive, coproductive model of design and highlights the positive contribution to communicating mental health made by those based in the humanities. © 2017, Springer International Publishing.

Surgeons have sought to reconstruct the ALL in ACL-deficient knees with the goal of restoring normal kinematics. Numerous surgical procedures have been developed over the last 50 years to correct the pathologic anterior and rotatory laxity seen with ACL tears. Initially, isolated lateral extra-articular tenodesis procedures were used. These procedures corrected the pathologic internal rotation laxity but their inability to adequately control anterior tibial translation led to a high rate of failure. Therefore, isolated lateral tenodesis procedures have fallen out of favor. With the advent of arthroscopy, isolated intra-articular ACL reconstructions became more popular. Some surgeons performed an additional lateral tenodesis procedure in conjunction with an intra-articular ACL reconstruction. Although these combined procedures have been abandoned by many surgeons, long-term results of these reconstructions have been encouraging. Because of the persistence of a pivot shift in some patients after isolated intra-articular ACL reconstruction, there has been a renewed interest in the anatomy and biomechanics of the ALL. Most recently, several authors have described an “anatomic” ALL reconstruction. Although early clinical results of these ALL reconstructions are encouraging, ongoing studies are still needed to better understand the biomechanical effects of these procedures on knee kinematics and on the intra-articular graft. The specific indications for lateral tenodeses and the ideal technique have yet to be determined. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","ACL reconstruction; anterolateral ligament; lateral extra-articular tenodeses; rotational laxity; surgical revision","Andrews technique; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; biomechanics; Ellison technique; human; kinematics; KJt technique; Losee technique; MacIntosh technique; Marcacci technique; medical history; Muller technique; outcome assessment; patient selection; priority journal; surgical technique; tenodesis; treatment indication",2-s2.0-85017420555

In the historical and literary sources the trope has had three distinguishable - and sometimes connected - variants since the 16th century, each of them also represented in Hungarian works of art. The story of the woman fighting at the side of her husband already cropped up in the Hungarian historical song created in the year of the battle: before the final charge the defenders wanted to kill their wives or brides to save them from falling into pagan hands but a valiant woman asked her husband to give her armour and weapon to fight the enemy. The story passed into the Transylvanian German poet Christian Schesaeus' Ruinae Pannonicae (1571) and into a Latin-language album in memory of Miklós Zrínyi published in Wittenberg in 1587. The motif is included in the mid-17th century biographies of women by the French Jesuit poet Pierre Le Moyne, in the February 1749 issue of Mercure de France and in several 18-19th century German and Austrian periodicals and literary works. From the early 19th century the heroic deed of the brave woman of Szigetvár appeared in several Hungarian magazines and pieces of juvenile literature often together with the story of the valiant women of Eger. The first visual representation of the brave woman of Szigetvár is the monumental painting about Zrínyi's charge from Szigetvár by Austrian Peter Krafft created upon the commission of the National Museum in 1825: there is a helmeted woman with a determined look in her eyes among the troops charging out of the castle. This detail was to be repeated not only in several engravings made after Krafft's painting but also in multiplied prints including title-pages of printed music. Another variant of the trope appears in the Italian Giovanni Michele Bruto's manuscript of the history of Hungary written in the 1570s-80s. In this version some brave women and mothers whom their husbands wanted to kill entreated them to let them die fighting against the foe with their children held as shields. This motif is included in German-language plays on Zrínyi by August Werthes and Theodor Körner written at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries. The women and children locked in the castle are also shown in Alajos Rohn's lithograph Zrínyi's oath after Béla Vízkelety's painting of a tableau vivant staged after Körner's Zrínyi play in a charity performance at the National Theatre of Pest on 3 April 1860. Women and children are important actors in Bertalan Székely's monumental painting Zrínyi's charge (1879- 1885) showing a woman picking up a fallen sword to fight the Ottomans. The third variant of the motif of the courageous woman cropped up in literature at the turn of the 18-19th century: in the plays by Werthes and Körner Zrínyi's wife blows up the powder-house with a torch to send as many of the intruding Ottomans into the netherworld as she could. The best-known example of the theme is the oil painting by Xavér Ferenc Weber The final moments of Szigetvár (1871) also shown at the 1873 Vienna World Fair. A fusion of historical and legendary elements can be seen in the 20th century colour print entitled Ilona Zrínyi's heroism in defence of the castle of Munkács 1688 in which Ilona Zrínyi is about to dip her torch into a powder barrel to kill the invading Ottomans while defending the castle of Munkács in 1688 (actually against the Habsburg imperial troops).","August Werthes; Christian Schesaeus; Giovanni Michele Bruto; Johann Peter Krafft; Pierre Le Moyne; Székely Bertalan; Theodor Körner; Vízkelety Béla",,2-s2.0-85028036701

I begin, in Section 1, by uncovering the fundamental concern that motivates Heidegger's essay. I show that Heidegger's reflections on art are part of his attempt to uncover a path beyond the history of metaphysics. I then suggest, in Section 2, that while Heidegger does think that art may allow for the overcoming of metaphysics, recent interpreters [Dreyfus (), Thomson (), and Young ()] have mistook the kind of art that Heidegger has in mind here. The kind of art that can allow for the overcoming of metaphysics, I argue, is not art that simply thematizes and/or reconfigures cultural worlds (as these interpreters have argued). It is instead what Heidegger calls ‘primal poesy’. After discussing the nature of primal poesy, I show in more detail how this kind of art may be capable of getting us beyond the history of metaphysics in Section 3. Finally, in Section 4, I reconsider the more common reading of ‘The Origin of the Work of Art’ in light of the interpretation I've offered in Sections 2 and 3. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,2-s2.0-85015228709

The controversy crystalizes the tension between a growing public desire for historical preservation in Taipei to safeguard shared history and restore collective memory, and profit-driven capitalistic development. The transformation of the factory over the past decade-from disused public property to a city-operated Urban Regeneration Station for fostering art and innovation, and finally to a demolition site that is being readied for new construction-illustrates the tug of war between the exigencies of cultural/historical preservation and urban renewal in Taipei. During the process, not only did citizen activists play a major role in raising the public's awareness of the unique value of the Nangang Bottle Cap Factory as one of the last major relics of Taipei's industrial heritage, graffiti artists also created works in the abandoned factory that dialogued about its contested future under a neoliberal capitalist regime.

The fourth is: ""[Om] so weinig as moontlik van die Vereenvoudigde Hollandse Spelling af te wijk"" (""to deviate as little as possible from the Simplified Dutch Spelling""). The VHS was one of the most important projects of the Dutch language movement in South Africa. The project's supporters aimed at restoring the position of Dutch as a medium of education and as a public language in the Cape Colony in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. To Afrikaners (and even the Dutch), Dutch was a difficult language to write by the end of the nineteenth century. Because of this, eminent Dutch language promoters aimed at simplifying Dutch as a written language. This movement came from the Zuid-Afrikaansche Taalbond (South African Language Association) in the Cape Colony, as well as teachers and journalists in the Free State and Transvaal, which both had Dutch as an official language. The Language Association was founded in 1890 for the purpose of promotion of knowledge of the people's language and establishing an emerging sense of nationality). With 47 votes against 36, it was decided that the ""language of the people"" would be Dutch rather than Afrikaans. Two of the most important figures in the Language Association were the theologian P.J.G. de Vos and linguist, W.J. Viljoen, professor of modern languages and history at the Victoria College (forerunner of the University of Stellenbosch). The Language Association realised that Dutch would be in a much stronger position to compete with English if its written form could be simplified. It was understood that they could tie in with one of the linguists in the Netherlands that also advocated for language simplification. It was R.A. Kollewijn, founder, in 1892, of the Association for the simplification of our Writing Language. According to him, Dutch spelling was too difficult and students had to spend unnecessary time mastering Dutch spelling. A joint conference of Afrikaners from Cape Town and Stellenbosch, as well as Transvaal and the Free State, instructed an executive committee in 1897 to obtain a statement of support from Dutch linguists and linguistic bodies. A number of suggestions for simplification in the direction of the Kollewijn spelling were adopted. The Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902) brought an end to language activities. However, soon after the war, simplification was again on the agenda when the Dutch movement met in Stellenbosch on 20 January 1903. This was as a result of a question from the Transvaal Education Department in 1902 whether the 1897 decisions were to be considered authoritative for the purpose of education. The executive committee asked Viljoen to prepare a report on the simplification of the written language. He consulted with linguists and other experts in the Netherlands and Belgium and on 19 September 1903 the Commissie voor Taal en Letteren bij de Maatschappij der Nederlandsche Letterkunde te Leiden (""Committee for Language and Literature in Leiden at the Society of Dutch Literature"") held a meeting in which twenty professors participated. Viljoen received a very positive supporting statement from management on 5 October 1903. A language conference was held on 28 December 1904 in Cape Town. The Language Association also invited delegates from the Transvaal, the Free State and Natal. All the education organisations were positive towards the recommendations and over the course of the following year, the VHS received additional support. Viljoen, De Vos and the other simplifiers therefore had reason to feel satisfied by the end of 1906. Education authorities supported the VHS and it was introduced in Dutch-Afrikaans newspapers such as Ons Land. But for speakers of Afrikaans outside of this intellectual space, even this simplified Dutch remained a difficult language. De Waal expressed this difficulty as follows in the newspaper De Goede Hoop (October 1904: ""Hebben wij Afrikaners het niet moeilijk genoeg om zowel Nederlandsch als Afrikaansch in dit Engelsche land in stand te houden? Laat de lieve Taalbond ons toch niet met een derde Hollandsche taal komen lastig vallen"". (""Do us Afrikaners not have it difficult enough to maintain both Dutch and Afrikaans in this English country? Let the dear Language Association not trouble us with a third Dutch language"".) The South African Dutch written language underwent changes in 1904 that would only be accepted in the written language in the Netherlands in 1934. But the modernised spelling could not save Dutch in South Africa. Afrikaans won, but the VHS still exercised influence on the Afrikaans spelling guidelines.","Afrikaans language movement; Afrikaans list of words and spelling guidelines; De Volksstem; Dutch language movement; F.V.

In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised method that combines the strengths of both approaches by exploiting both geographic and semantic features.

Whether the performance of additional technical tests (e.g. blood chemistry, ECG, spirometry, chest x-ray) can contribute to a reduction of perioperative risk is often not very well known or controversial. Similarly, there is considerable uncertainty among anaesthesiologists, internists and surgeons with respect to the perioperative management of the patient's long-Term medication. Therefore, the German Scientific Societies of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (DGAI), Internal Medicine (DGIM) and Surgery (DGCH) have joined to elaborate recommendations on the preoperative evaluation of adult patients prior to elective, non-cardio-Thoracic surgery, which have been initially published in 2010. These recommendations have now been updated based on the current literature and existing international guidelines. In the first part the general principles of preoperative evaluation are described (part A). The current concepts for extended evaluation of patients with known or suspected major cardiovascular disease are presented in part B. Finally, the perioperative management of patients' long-Term medication is discussed (part C). The concepts proposed in these interdisciplinary recommendations endorsed by the DGAI, DGIM and DGCH provide a common basis for a structured preoperative risk assessment and management. These recommendations aim to ensure that surgical patients undergo a rational preoperative assessment and at the same time to avoid unnecessary, costly and potentially dangerous testing. The joint recommendations reflect the current state-of-The-Art knowledge as well as expert opinions because scientific-based evidence is not always available. These recommendations will be subject to regular re-evaluation and updating when new validated evidence becomes available.","Interdisciplinary recommendation; Perioperative risk - cardiac risk; Preoperative evaluation; Pulmonary risk","adult; Article; blood chemistry; elective surgery; electrocardiogram; human; medical history; medical society; perioperative period; physical examination; practice guideline; preoperative evaluation; risk management; risk reduction; spirometry; thorax radiography",2-s2.0-85021069063

While these individuals are surviving into old age, they may, however, be experiencing 'accelerated aging' with greater declines in physical function than that observed among comparably matched individuals free of HIV. This decline is not well understood and it remains unclear if physical decline correlates with the degree of immunosuppression based on CD4 lymphocyte nadir. Methods In a cross-sectional study of accelerated aging in the older HIV-infected population on antiretroviral therapy (ART), physical performance evaluations were completed on a cohort of 107 HIV-infected subjects, age 50 years or older (with no HIV-1 RNA >200 copies/mL in the prior 12 months), and compared to reference ranges for age-and gender-matched HIVuninfected persons. Physical performance testing consisted of four validated assessments: the 2.4-meter walk, 30-second chair stand, grip strength and 6-minute walk test. Results When compared to age-and gender-matched HIV-uninfected reference controls, older HIVinfected persons had diminished physical function. No correlation was found between physical function and degree of immunosuppression as determined by pre-ART CD4 nadir. Conclusions Despite improved survival, HIV±infected adults on suppressive ART have diminished physical function compared to HIV-uninfected persons. The degree of HIV-associated immunosuppression does not correlate with the observed degree of physical function decline in older HIV-infected persons, suggesting the decline is mediated by other mechanisms. © 2017 Khoury et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",,"efavirenz plus emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil; virus RNA; anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; adult; African American; age distribution; aged; aging; antiretroviral therapy; Article; Black person; body mass; cardiovascular disease; Caucasian; CD4 lymphocyte count; cohort analysis; comorbidity; comparative study; cross-sectional study; disease duration; esophagus candidiasis; ethnic difference; female; functional status; gait speed; grip strength; health care cost; health status; human; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; immunosuppressive treatment; kidney disease; length of stay; liver disease; major clinical study; male; medical history; middle aged; musculoskeletal system parameters; outcome assessment; physical activity; physical disability; physical performance; Pneumocystis pneumonia; sex difference; six minute walk test; survival rate; United States; validation process; HIV Infections; pathophysiology; Anti-HIV Agents; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Southeastern United States",2-s2.0-85021645873

Women's art culture contained internal class tensions; women backed women's art labor both as a new artistic career path and as charity for the deserving poor. Cincinnati's women museum supporters exacerbated such class tensions when they targeted elite male donors by promoting art training to reform working-class men who lacked the unifying refinement that mitigated class tensions in women's art culture.

Within this project, monuments in four and a half of Hungary's 19 counties and the Buda districts of Budapest were processed and published in 12 volumes between 1953 and 1987, by adopting the conception of the Austrian inventory of monuments (Österreichische Kunsttopographie) published from 1907. Sufficient conditions for systematic work for this fundamentally important project for both art history and monument conservation were only given in the period specified above. In connection with the radical institutional changes brought about by the building out of a Soviet-type state administration from 1948, the paper reconstructs the series of events which made it possible - based on the excellent professional legacy and human resource and thanks to the keen judgement of some specialists in key positions - that this grand project could be launched with great zeal and survived - at a decelerating pace but at unchanged professional level - for three decades to come. The professional contents of the program is illumined by three documents and a conference paper read in November 1950 on the conception of the inventory of Hungarian historical monuments, which are enclosed in the supplement. The scholar to present the project was the art historian Dezsod Dercsényi, who became the supreme professional guide of Hungarian monument protection until his retirement by virtue of his professional competence and exceptional diplomatic skills. The inventory was being elaborated under the aegis of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences reorganized upon the Soviet model in late 1949. Against this background did that unique intellectual constellation evolve in which the cooperation of the Marxist philosopher György Lukács, who had returned from emigration in Moscow in 1945 and played an active role in the Sovietization of culture including scholarship; of the Christian philosopher Lajos Fülep, a youthful intellectual comrade of Lukács in internal exile in this period whom Lukács asked to head the art historical community; of Dercsényi and the excellent specialists promoted the cause of the registration of Hungarian historical monuments to success. In this way the major break in history did not entail the interruption of so-far achieved results and up-to-date strategic endeavours in the studied area of culture and science but resulted in an unprecedented consolidation of the positions of Hungarian monument protection and art history at an elevated level.",,,2-s2.0-85028075866

Both geographers and medical-health professionals, then, are increasingly (re)making and understanding various worlds through the humanities. In this paper we explore the histories of humanities in both geography and the medical-health sciences, especially medicine: we argue the two disciplines have much to learn from each other's engagement and work with the humanities. Focusing on the increasing use of narrative and storytelling in both disciplines, we argue that deployment of humanities-based frameworks and impulses must not be taken up without careful and critical analytical reflection.

De manière impromptue : vers une démarche critique sur les méthodes de mise en récit et les méthodologies en géographie et en sciences médicales et de la santé: L'intérêt pour les sciences humaines par la géographie et les sciences médicales et de la santé s'inscrit dans une longue tradition. Au cours de la dernière décennie, les deux disciplines ont connu une importante croissance de cadres théoriques, de stratégies pédagogiques et de méthodes de recherche qui font appel aux arts visuels et à la littérature, à l'autoréflexion critique, à des outils et modes d'expression novateurs, voire même à une participation directe ou à des partenariats avec des artistes, conservateurs, auteurs, praticiens de l'art dramatique et d'autres professionnels du domaine des arts.

Cet article brosse un tableau historique des sciences humaines tant en géographie qu'en sciences médicales et de la santé, en particulier la médecine : nous soutenons que les deux disciplines ont beaucoup à apprendre l'une de l'autre sur l'intérêt que chacune porte aux sciences humaines. En mettant l'accent sur le recours grandissant par les deux disciplines à la narration et à la mise en récit, nous faisons valoir l'idée que le déploiement des cadres et des impulsions fondés sur les sciences humaines ne peut pas être envisagé sans mener au préalable une réflexion analytique minutieuse et critique.

Nevertheless, the magnitude, trend and risk factors for ART discontinuation have not been explored extensively. We carried out a retrospective data analysis to assess prevalence, trend and risk factors for ART discontinuation among adults in Southwest Ethiopia. Methods 12 years retrospective cohort analysis was performed with 4900 HIV-infected adult patients between 21 June 2003 and 15 March 2015 registered at the ART clinic at Jimma University Teaching Hospital. ART discontinuation could be loss to follow-up, defaulting and/or stopping medication while remaining in care. Because data for 2003 and 2015 were incomplete, the 10 years data were used to describe trends for ART discontinuation using a line graph. We used binary logistic regression to identify factors that were correlated with ART discontinuation. To handle missing data, we applied multiple imputations assuming missing at random pattern. Results In total, 4900 adult patients enrolled on ART, of whom 1090 (22.3%) had discontinued, 954 (19.5%) had transferred out, 300 (6.1%) had died, 2517 (51.4%) were alive and on ART, and the remaining 39 (0.8%) had unknown outcome status. The trend of ART discontinuation showed an upward direction in the recent times and reached a peak, accounting for a magnitude of 10%, in 2004 and 2005. Being a female (AOR = 2.1, 95%CI: 1.7-2.8), having an immunological failure (AOR = 2.3, 1.9-8.2), having tuberculosis/HIV co-infection (AOR = 1.5, 1.1-2.1) and no previous history of HIV testing (AOR = 1.8, 1.4-2.9) were the risk factors for ART discontinuation. Conclusions One out of five adults had discontinued from ART, and the trend of ART discontinuation increased recently. Discontinued adults were more likely to be females, tuberculosis/HIV co-infected, with immunological failure and no history of HIV testing. Therefore, it is vital to implement effective programs such as community ART distribution and linkage-case-management to enhance ART linkage and retention. © 2017 Gesesew et al.

Methods: The current study was conducted in the Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital Clinic in Paris, France, where 4501 PLHIV consulted in 2014. We used the medical database Nadis to describe patients' ART, characteristics and estimated costs. When assessing the budgetary impact of potential switches, we considered patients' history of failure, CD4+ cell count, plasma viral load, resistance mutations, hepatitis B surface antigen or HLAB57∗01 profile. Results: A total of 4238 of 4501 patients were on ART (94%). The total annual cost of ART prescribed was estimated at €48 280 200 in 2014; first/second (simplification)-line regimens represented 25% (1076/4238) of the treated PLHIV and 23% (€11 209 000) of the annual cost. For these PLHIV, we considered switches from the most common ART regimens (protease inhibitor boosted by ritonavir or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor + two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors) to less-expensive regimens. We found savings ranging from €36 100 to 1472 600/year. Savings were the highest when we considered switching to generic-based regimens or from protease inhibitor-based triple therapy to protease inhibitor monotherapy. Conclusion: Costs associated with ART prescriptions are very high. Switches to generic-based regimens are associated with large savings. However, those targeting protease inhibitor regimens are also associated with substantial savings and should be considered. Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

By capturing the recent tendencies of political tabooization and de-tabooization of the main national identity signifiers, it is possible to discern several clear lines of collective relationships towards the country's cultural traumas. First, the cultural victim trauma related to the Homeland War is sanctified and frozen. Furthermore, narratives built from that period have been increasingly applied to the Second World War, in order to represent the quisling Independent State of Croatia in a more positive light. Such attempts of making an ideological continuity are a clear falsification of history. Second, the cultural perpetrator trauma from both periods is denied and silenced. There have been several attempts to question both forms of cultural trauma in the fields of arts and civil society, but they are of limited reach and influence, especially because the mainstream media, political and religious actors promote the relativization and revision of the past. At the end of the paper, the author gives several pieces of advice for public action in order to change this mainstream condition of silencing and the tabooization of troubling traces from the past.","Cultural trauma; Defense mechanisms; National identity; Political Taboo; Theatrical plays",,2-s2.0-85021373100

However, chronic pain, depression, and substance use, all of which are prevalent in this population, can reduce the quality of patient-provider engagement. We hypothesized a model in which chronic pain, depression, and substance use would be associated with poorer patient-provider engagement, which would be positively associated with adherence, with the latter associated positively with viral suppression. We analyzed data from the BEACON study, which included surveys from 383 PLHIV who were primarily African American, on ART, and had histories of drug use. Due to six missing cases on the chronic pain variable, we used data from 377 respondents in a structural equation model. Chronic pain and depressive symptoms were significantly associated with poorer patient-provider engagement, while substance use was associated with better engagement. Patient-provider engagement in turn was associated with better ART adherence, which was associated with higher viral suppression. Results suggest the role of chronic pain in poor patient-physician engagement in this population, which has potential implications for quality of HIV patient care and health outcomes.

In this sense, the usefulness of hyperspectral imaging was demonstrated. It allows pigment characterization of the whole painting. However, it also sometimes requires the complementation of other point-by-point techniques. In the present article, the advantages of hyperspectral imaging over point-by-point spectroscopic analysis were evaluated. For that purpose, three paintings were analysed by hyperspectral imaging, handheld X-ray fluorescence and handheld Raman spectroscopy in order to determine the best non-invasive technique for pigment identifications. Thanks to this work, the main pigments used in Aragonese artworks, and especially in Goya’s paintings, were identified and mapped by imaging reflection spectroscopy. All the analysed pigments corresponded to those used at the time of Goya. Regarding the techniques used, the information obtained by the hyperspectral imaging and point-by-point analysis has been, in general, different and complementary. Given this fact, selecting only one technique is not recommended, and the present work demonstrates the usefulness of the combination of all the techniques used as the best non-invasive methodology for the pigments’ characterization. Moreover, the proposed methodology is a relatively quick procedure that allows a larger number of Goya’s paintings in the museum to be surveyed, increasing the possibility of obtaining significant results and providing a chance for extensive comparisons, which are relevant from the point of view of art history issues. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","EDXRF; Goya; Hyperspectral imaging; In situ; Non-invasive; Pigments; Raman","Characterization; Noninvasive medical procedures; Pigments; Spectroscopic analysis; Spectroscopy; X ray spectrometers; EDXRF; Goya; Non-invasive; Pigment characterization; Point by point techniques; Point-by-point analysis; Raman; Reflection spectroscopy; Hyperspectral imaging",2-s2.0-85018245341

However, because it was written and directed by a non-Greek, US expatriate Jules Dassin, and because it was financed and distributed by Hollywood major United Artists, the film has been marginalized in Greek cinema histories and excised from Greek cinema canons. If they mention it at all, Greek scholars place it outside the parameters of Greek national cinema and treat it as a special case. Meanwhile, Never on Sunday has attracted considerable attention from US film scholars, who nonetheless have approached it as a foreign (i.e., not American) production or as an early example of the Euro-American art film. This intriguing lack of specificity in terms of the film's nationality is the starting point for discussing what constitutes a Greek film. Through examining the film's production history and by placing it within an industrial context of film production in Greece in the 1960s, I will argue that this was a rare example of a Greek film with international ambition, therefore inviting Greek film histories to revise their approach to the film as well as their understanding of national cinemas.","Film industry; Greek cinema; Greek film; Jules dassin; National cinema; Never on sunday",,2-s2.0-85026215901

With accession to the European Union in 2003, Maltese became an official language of the Union. The National Council for the Maltese Language was also established at this time (sections 8-9). In order to gauge the de jure and de facto linguistic situation, this paper explores various domains. In the legislative sphere (section 12) it is found that laws should be promulgated in both Maltese and English, where the Maltese text is binding in case of conflict between the two versions, but in fact there are loopholes allowing secondary legislation to be passed in English only. In very general terms, Maltese is widely spoken while English tends to be used more in writing, a case in point being the day to day practice of government entities (section 11). In the educational sector (section 14), Maltese and English are both accorded the same level of importance but, depending on the type of school, English is more or less favoured. On the other hand, the use of Maltese is much more prevalent in the religious sphere and the media (sections 13, 15) although code-switching with English also takes place in the broadcast media.

The appearance of a ""Miao King"" and four ""Wu kings"" centering anti-Qing resistance in an intractable highland-utilizing native legends, spirit possession, investment of officials, and multi-ethnic recruitment-suggests a case of""Zomia"" (the vast Southeast Asian Massif) prophets in action, as Scott himself suggests. Closer examination, however, reveals a more complex and uncertain picture, characterized by division between rival lords and an overall deatth of institutional, ideological, or cosmological elaboration, all further obscured by a paucity of historical sources. The Miao kings might be seen as prophets of renewal in a general sense, but the fit is inexact. There is still value, however, in considering Scott's model in the study of this event. It enables a sharper conceptualization of the agency of the Miao people, while offering a case for comparison with analogous instances of religiously-based native resistance on other Qing frontiers.","1795-97 Hunan Miao revolt; James Scott; Miao; Miao Frontier; Miao King; Prophets of renewal; Wu King",,2-s2.0-85027717293

The state-of-the-art portable handheld X-ray Fluorescence (pXRF) and laboratory micro X-ray Fluorescence (μXRF) instruments provide a relatively inexpensive, fast and non-destructive way of acquiring these trace element composition data. However, there are well-known issues and limitations regarding the method of spectrum acquisition and the conversion of XRF spectra into quantitative elemental mass fractions. This study offers a guideline for the appropriate use of these XRF techniques for the study of carbonates. Using certified calcium carbonate and dolomite standards, accuracy and reproducibility of a pXRF (Bruker AXS Tracer IV) and a μXRF (Bruker M4 Tornado) device are tested under various measurement conditions. The experimental set-up allowed for the variation of several parameters, including the measurement area, integration time, quantification method and measurement strategy. The effects on the accuracy and reproducibility of the quantified elemental abundance results are examined to assess the optimal performance conditions for both devices for the determination of trace element abundances in natural carbonates. The limits of detection and quantification are evaluated for both instruments for a range of trace elements commonly used as palaeoenvironmental proxies (e.g. Sr, Mn and Fe). The quality of the XRF spectra is evaluated using spectral processing software. As a result, two new methods for the determination of optimized parameter combinations are proposed for a range of commonly used elements. The Time of Stable Reproducibility (TSR) is based on optimizing the measurement reproducibility by examining the change of the relative standard deviation per time unit and proposing an integration time threshold for reproducible measurements. The Time of Stable Accuracy (TSA) is based on optimizing the measurement accuracy by studying changes in accuracy as a function of increasing integration time and defining an integration time threshold for accurate measurements. An overview table including minimum integration times by which a reliable measurement is achieved is provided for all analyzed elements and experimental set-ups for this study. However, the methodological approach that is developed here is applicable to other (carbonate) materials as well. A comparison between the two X-ray fluorescence instruments allows the evaluation of their respective advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we recommend optimal measurement strategies and techniques for specific research questions. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Calcium carbonate; Carbonates; Carbonation; Fluorescence; Integration; Quality control; Strontium; Trace elements; X ray spectrometers; Measurement reproducibility; Measurement strategies; Methodological approach; Micro X-ray fluorescence; Optimal measurement strategies; Relative standard deviations; Trace element analysis; Trace element composition; Parameter estimation",2-s2.0-85021801189

As part of this growth the publishing industry provides countless textbooks. This paper presents a specialized textbooks data analysis sheet for teaching Spanish as a second language. The paper starts with a brief state of the art about teaching Spanish as a Foreign Language. Then it specifies the differences between materials evaluation and materials analysis based on B. Tomlinson's theories. The paper also explains the importance of analyzing materials through specialized data analysis sheets. The methodological framework illustrates the history of materials data analysis sheets in Colombia, where this research takes place. Next it's shown the theoretical foundations and the structure of the data analysis sheet proposed in this paper. This data analysis sheet has four detailed analysis sections that correspond to the external description; the internal description; the analysis of communicative, linguistic, cultural and evaluative contents; and ends with a section for observations that allows the analyst to point out ideas that are not contemplated in the original data analysis sheet. These analysis sections allow teachers to know the superficial and deep structures of textbooks. Through these structures teachers and analysts can study and understand the characteristics of textbooks, allowing them to effectively use the textbooks resources, both inside and outside of the classroom.","Data analysis sheet; Materials analysis; Materials evaluation; Teaching Spanish as second language; Textbooks",,2-s2.0-85021375756

We combined geochemical and technological characterization of obsidian assemblages from surface and stratigraphic contexts spanning the Holocene, and a preliminary geoarchaeological study of the sources. The goals were to assess the provenance, mode of supply, use, and discard of obsidian artifacts on the basis of information on the structure of the two main regional sources: Cerro Huenul, located in the lowlands, and Laguna del Maule, located in the Andean highlands. We conducted geoarchaeological field sampling at different altitudes of the Barrancas River fluvial deposits to study the geomorphic impact on the secondary structure of the highland source. Preliminary geoarchaeological results allow extending the area of availability up to 90 km towards the lowlands from the outcrops. In addition, we performed non-destructive XRF analyses on 266 lithic artifacts, which were placed along a continuum of reduction. 89% of the artifacts corresponded to the local Cerro Huenul source, while 11% to Laguna del Maule. While the artifacts made on Cerro Huenul obsidian were represented by the full reduction sequence, those from Laguna del Maule are only represented by advanced stages. We integrate these results with information on the frequencies of projectile points, ceramics, and rock-art motifs for the two main archaeological sites in the region: Cueva Huenul 1 and Cueva Yagui. These proxies indicate that the sites have different place use histories, providing a scheme for the analysis of human use of the regional landscape. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Geoarchaeology; Lithic technology; Obsidian geochemistry; Organization of mobility; Patagonia",,2-s2.0-85018479174

Written in blank verse, the play's poetic style and wealth of inter-textual references to personal and public history attest to Barnes's aesthetic savvy and modernist sensibility. Not only does the play rely on the kind of role-switching associated with Platonic dialogues whereby materiality is excoriated to give way to purer, loftier ideas, but it also deploys a quest for state (or family) justice as a theatrical performance that is strong on stylized politics, but short on ethics and ideas. In its blending of the political and the abstract, The Antiphon evokes what Alain Badiou refers to in Rhapsody for the Theatre as a ""theatre of ideas"" that combines an artistic ""heresy in action"" with a ""figurative reknotting of politics"" (13). In The Antiphon, such ""reknotting"" not only points to the destructive politics permeating 1930s and 1950s America, but also exposes Barnes's search for a method that would simultaneously rupture and transcend the very limitations of art forms by transforming politics into a philosophically-charged theatre of ideas.

It is widely accepted that the mainstream Confucians before 1840s refused to understand Western religion and learnings because of their steadfast Confucian-centrism or over-emphasis on studying the philology of Confucian classics. However, the rejection or marginalization of Western knowledge was evidently formed in the wake of careful scrutiny instead of predetermined by arbitrary or irrational factors. Significantly, Christianity and Western learning were marginalized by political and academic elites who were active in political reform and were well versed in the art of governance. Our discussion would focus on Huangchao Jingshi Wenbian, or the Collected writings on statecraft from the Qing dynasty, which was compiled by two influential scholarbureaucrats, He Changling and Wei Yuan. The paper would illustrate how mainstream elites understood Western knowledge and eventually decided to marginalize them through the study of the compilation preference and the articles collected. In the last part, we will examine die marginalization of Western knowledge in early 19th century as reflected in Huangchao Jingshi Wenbian and evaluate the importance of this phenomenon to the 19th century cultural and intellectual history of China.

The albums comprise several so-far little known and unpublished depictions of actors of the age such as István Széchenyi, Miklós Wesselényi, László Teleki, Sándor Teleki, Ferdinand V, Metternich or Emperor Francis Joseph, as well as the less widely known figures of the Transylvanian public scene and nobility, and officers of the imperial army. The set of over five hundred drawings, some only rough sketches, are not only intriguing in terms of iconography but at the same time have intrinsic artistic value as well. The main asset of the albums is the representation of the 19th century small world of ordinary people besides the pictures of representative personages. In addition to unusual themes the artist also challenges some taboos and depicts the abuses of power showing some infamous aspects of the life of the imperial forces, the aristocracy or the clergy. By occupation, Transylvanian-born János Petrichevich Horváth was a high-ranking officer in the imperial army, and as such he was a committed defender of the feudal social structure and the monarchy, but as an amateur graphic artist he revealed quite a different side of his activities. Although there is no information on his regular artistic training, his works suggest a trained draughtsman mastering refined drawing techniques, with a sense of colour, careful spatial composition and exact anatomical rendering, correct perspective view and sensitive characterization. The most remarkable works in the albums are the caricatures, which makes scholarship revise the beginnings and history of the genre in Hungary. Though the first half of the 19th century is regarded as a period of rudimentary attempts in Hungarian caricature history, the unfolding of the genre being dated to after the Compromise (1867), the albums of János Petrichevich Horváth render the Hungarian manifestations of the genre commensurable with the European crop of the genre at an earlier date. Of course, Hungarian art struggling with several problems of (self) definition, institutionalization, lack of infrastructure, etc. did not have a James Gillray (1756-1815) regarded as the ""father of political caricature"" or an Honoré Daumier (1808-1879) yet, but Petrichevich's works do add several hues to the general tone of backwardness. As a conspicuous analogy, most caricatures of Gillray mock George III whose mental illness was caused by porphyria, Daumier's most famous caricatures are of the pear-headed Louis Philippe I, and Petrichevich's several caricature sketches depict the hydrocephalic Ferdinand V. Thus his works can be taken as the start of Hungarian political and cultural caricature whose artistic rendering and embarrassing sincerity project to us a different picture of the Reform Age clad so far in the veil of the golden age or of the customary image of the imperial forces as devilish impostors.","Honoré Daumier; James Gillray; Petrichevich Horváth János; Political cartoon; Széchenyi István; Wesselényi Miklós",,2-s2.0-85028059291

Large stresses are generated in the anterior muscles that cross the knee and hip joint, mainly employing the quadriceps at an intensity of 30–40% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), sometimes exceeding 100% MVC. Better sailing level is partially determined by a lower rate of neuromuscular fatigue during hiking and for ≈60% predicted by a higher maximal isometric quadriceps strength. Although useful in exercise testing, prediction of hiking endurance capacity based on the changes in surface EMG in thigh and trunk muscles during a hiking maintenance task is not reliable. This could probably be explained by the varying exercise intensity and joint angles, and the great number of muscles and joints involved in hiking. Highlights Dr Jacques Rogge, former president of the International Olympic Committee and Olympic Finn sailor, was the first to study muscle activity during sailing using invasive needle EMG to obtain his Master degree in Sports Medicine at the Ghent University. Hiking is a critical bilateral and multi-joint movement during dinghy racing, accounting for >60% of the total upwind leg time. Hiking generates large stresses in the anterior muscles that cross the knee and hip joint. Hiking is considered as a quasi-isometric bilateral knee extension exercise. Muscle activity measurements during sailing, recorded by means of EMG, show a mean contraction intensity of 30-40% maximal voluntary contraction with peaks exceeding 100%. Hiking performance is strongly related to the development of neuromuscular fatigue in the quadriceps muscle. Since maximal strength is an important determinant of neuromuscular fatigue during hiking, combined strength and endurance training should be incorporated in the training program of dinghy sailors. © 2017 European College of Sport Science.","electromyography; hiking; muscle activity; muscle fatigue; Sailing","art; Belgium; endurance; exercise; female; history; human; male; movement (physiology); muscle fatigue; muscle isometric contraction; orthopedics; physiology; quadriceps femoris muscle; resistance training; ship; sport; sports medicine; Belgium; Exercise; Female; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Isometric Contraction; Male; Movement; Muscle Fatigue; Orthopedics; Physical Endurance; Quadriceps Muscle; Resistance Training; Ships; Sports; Sports Medicine",2-s2.0-85017452464

Drawing on evidence of both cultural encounters and internal drivers for progressivism and reform, this book re-evaluates the history of Japanese education to help inform ongoing and future debates about education policy and practice worldwide. With contributions from Japanese scholars specialising in the history and philosophy of education and curriculum studies, chapters consider key collaborative improvements to teacher education, as well as group learning, 'life education', the creative arts and writing, and education for girls and women. The book examines Western influences, including John Dewey, Carleton Washburne and A. S. Neill, as well as Japan's own progressive exports, such as holistic Zenjin education, Children's Villages and Lesson Study, highlighting cultural encounters and progressive initiatives at both transnational and national levels. The chapters reflect on historical and political background, motivations, influences and the impact of Japanese progressive education. They also stimulate, through argument and critical discussion, a continuing discourse concerning principles, policy, politics and practices of education in an increasingly globalised society. A rigorous and critical study of the history of progressive education in Japan, this book will interest an international readership of academics, researchers and postgraduate students in the fields of progressive education, comparative education, social and cultural history, history of education, Japanese studies, curriculum studies, and the history of childhood. © 2017 selection and editorial matter, Yoko Yamasaki and Hiroyuki Kuno; individual chapters, the contributors.

The interaction between these two developments, by contrast, has only rarely been studied, and if so, mainly with regard to the visual arts. Within the literary tradition, only the travel literature of the 18th and 19th centuries has received any attention. How the relationship of landscape and ruins was conceived in the learned, mostly Latin literature of earlier centuries has never been examined in any detail. The present article tries to make good on this deficit. In the first section, it is shown how, from the Renaissance onwards, ruins came to be seen as an integral part of certain landscapes. This development was complemented by a perception of landscapes as ruins from the 17th century onwards, the theme of section two. By way of conclusion, the convergence of landscape appreciation and ruinophilia in early modern times is explained with recourse to the emergence of a new historical consciousness: the new interest in landscape, ruins, and their interplay was kindled by a growing awareness of the fact that these environmental features carried precious information about, and could even be seen as an embodiment of, the history of mankind and the earth. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","early modern period; history; landscape; Latin; ruins",,2-s2.0-85021344245

While recognized in the global world of science new sub-discipline: the new science of martial arts is located in agonology (science about struggle). The aim of this very general review are the most important-according to the authors of the work-issues of fighting raised in the work of Nobel Prize winners in literature, which may be an important inspiration for the emerging of martial arts bibliotherapy within the broadly understood prophylactic and therapeutic agonology. Henryk Sienkiewicz (Nobel prize 1905), by compiling different sources and literary syncretism, created the original historical novel of the adventures of great action-escape, kidnapping, chases, liberation and other types of threats that the heroes of his works could overcome. Rudyard Kipling (1907) in colourfully and adventure led narrative released numerous parallels between the animal behaviour and the people, that very often cause conflicts and misunderstandings terminated by bitter fighting. Wladyslaw Stanislaw Reymont (1924) situates the fight for the rights and dignity of life in the environment associated with the world of nature and its impact on human life and its social environment. William Faulkner (1949) refers to personal observation and experience from the period of the service and fights for military aviation, while Winston Churchill (1953) describes an armed conflict in a global dimension, that is, the fight at the macro scale. Ernest Hemingway (1954) in the history of cultural and literary thoughts on the phenomenon of fighting of a man with the lively nature has left perhaps the most multifarious legacy. The main character of the famous novel by Boris Pasternak (1958)-Doctor Zhivago-struggling with adversity, pays a personal defeat and loses as a man ill-adapted to the new reality. John Steinbeck (1962), his loudest novel-The Grapes of Wrath-devoted to the fight against exploitation of farm workers in California and the nascent capitalism. Nobel Prize winners Mikhail Sholokhov (1965) and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn (1970) show people who are not able to break no dramas of life (the war, the Nazi camps, Soviet gulags, loss of loved ones, the disease and the lack of prospects for life). Regardless of the diversity of literary narrative at the highest level of all the works combine two common possibilities: 1) secondary interpretation of the descriptions of battles (including the inner fight of a man) using the concept and methodology agonology 2) generalization in interdisciplinary approach, which, on the one hand, enriches the cognitive layer multithreaded issues of struggle, on the other hand, facilitates the implementation of the specific objectives of the application-prophylactic or therapeutic-individually tailored. © 2016 the Authors.

The development of effective approaches to increase HIV diagnoses and engage PLWH in subsequent steps of the treatment cascade could lead to earlier and sustained ART treatment resulting in viral suppression. There is an unmet need for research applying the treatment cascade to improve outcomes for those with criminal justice involvement. Methods: The Seek, Test, Treat, and Retain (STTR) criminal justice (CJ) cohort combines data from 11 studies across the HIV treatment cascade that focused on persons involved in the criminal justice system, often but not exclusively for reasons related to substance use. The studies were conducted in a variety of CJ settings and collected information across 11 pre-selected domains: demographic characteristics, CJ involvement, HIV risk behaviors, HIV and/or Hepatitis C infections, laboratory measures of CD4 T-cell count (CD4) and HIV RNA viral load (VL), mental illness, health related quality of life (QoL), socioeconomic status, health care access, substance use, and social support. Results: The STTR CJ cohort includes data on 11,070 individuals with and without HIV infection who range in age from 18 to 77 years, with a median age at baseline of 37 years. The cohort reflects racial, ethnic and gender distributions in the U.S. CJ system, and 64% of participants are African-American, 12% are Hispanic and 83% are men. Cohort members reported a wide range of HIV risk behaviors including history of injection drug use and, among those who reported on pre-incarceration sexual behaviors, the prevalence of unprotected sexual intercourse ranged across studies from 4% to 79%. Across all studies, 53% percent of the STTR CJ cohort reported recent polysubstance use. Conclusions: The STTR CJ cohort is comprised of participants from a wide range of CJ settings including jail, prison, and community supervision who report considerable diversity in their characteristics and behavioral practices. We have developed harmonized measures, where feasible, to improve the integration of these studies together to answer questions that cannot otherwise be addressed. © 2017 The Author(s).","Criminal justice; Data harmonization; HIV",,2-s2.0-85019377487

According to this approach – termed visual critical pedagogy – art is an integral part of the textures of society and culture and their manifold and complex visual expressions, including the more controversial and subversive among them. It objects to locking art and visual culture in art departments, and to restricting art history to a formalist analysis of ‘masterpieces’ – which represent primarily the Western art market and its underlying politics. It likewise rejects the conception of art history as the history of artists and art movements – a conservative approach still prevalent in many academic institutions. Integrating critical pedagogy with visual culture provides fertile ground for an educational practice within art classes and beyond them. Visual critical pedagogy is formulated using the concepts exposure, deciphering, representation and visibility, shared by both critical pedagogy and visual culture. These are discussed in the context of educational projects and activities planned and implemented by Jewish and Arab students enrolled in an education-through-art program in an academic college in northern Israel. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group","Critical pedagogy; deciphering; exposure; representation; visibility; visual culture",,2-s2.0-85019229374

Grounding my inquiry in textual analysis and archival research, I argue that the tension, anxiety and ambivalence that marked the film industry’s relationship to television in 1953 were internal and intrinsic to the broadcast and were constantly managed and negotiated, with varying degrees of success, through the planning, promotion and production of the event. © 2017 IAMHIST & Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group",,,2-s2.0-85019561586

Errors in data can be incredibly costly and disruptive, leading to loss of revenue, incorrect conclusions, and misguided policy decisions. While data cleaning tools can purge datasets of many errors before the data is used, applications and users interacting with the data can introduce new errors. Subsequent valid updates can obscure these errors and propagate them through the dataset causing more discrepancies. Even when some of these discrepancies are discovered, they are often corrected superficially, on a case-by-case basis, further obscuring the true underlying cause, and making detection of the remaining errors harder. In this paper, we propose QFix, a framework that derives explanations and repairs for discrepancies in relational data, by analyzing the effect of queries that operated on the data and identifying potential mistakes in those queries. QFix is flexible, handling scenarios where only a subset of the true discrepancies is known, and robust to different types of update workloads. We make four important contributions: (a) we formalize the problem of diagnosing the causes of data errors based on the queries that operated on and introduced errors to a dataset; (b) we develop exact methods for deriving diagnoses and fixes for identified errors using state-of-the-art tools; (c) we present several optimization techniques that improve our basic approach without compromising accuracy, and (d) we leverage a tradeoff between accuracy and performance to scale diagnosis to large datasets and query logs, while achieving near-optimal results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of QFix through extensive evaluation over benchmark and synthetic data. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",,"Information retrieval; Data-driven applications; Large datasets; Optimization techniques; Policy decisions; Relational data; State of the art; Underlying cause; Update workload; Errors",2-s2.0-85021248972

Much extant psychological research on selfies has taken a pathologizing view of the phenomenon, focusing on its relationship to narcissism. Our investigation seeks to contribute to a holistic, contextualized and cultural perspective. We focus on the context of museums, places where art, history, education, and culture merge into the selfie taking behaviors of patrons. First, we explore theory salient to our topic of selfie taking, finding selfies to be an important way to construct ongoing series of narratives about the self. We use concepts of identity work, dramaturgy, and impression management to understand it in this light. We relate embodiment within the museum to the selfie's performative acts and expand upon notions that emphasize and distinguish the aesthetic elements present in many aspects of everyday life. We also question the ability of the museum selfie to destabilize. We also explore the contextual effects of mimicry and social norms. After describing our ethnographic and netnographic method, we investigate the museum selfie phenomenon. We begin with some observations on the extent of selfie-taking in contemporary culture as well as its evolution. Then, we consider selfies as a type of dynamic art form. Our analysis identifies a range of different types of museum selfies: art interactions, blending into art, mirror selfies, silly/clever selfies, contemplative selfies, and iconic selfies. Considered and studied in context, the museum selfie phenomenon reveals far more than the narcissism of the sort explored by past psychological research. The museum provides a stage for identity work that offers an opportunity for the selfie to be used not only for superficial performances but also in the pursuit of more profound self-reflection and its communication. Our ethnographic exploration of the selfie sees it as more than a quest for attention but less than a genuinely destabilizing social force. Selfie taking is complex and multidimensional, a cultural and social act, a call for connection, an act of mimicry, and part of people's ever-incomplete identity projects. © 2017 Kozinets, Gretzel and Dinhopl.","Aesthetic consumption; Embodiment; Identity; Museum; Performance; Self-presentation; Selfie",,2-s2.0-85019605436

But has cognitive neuroscience indeed something to offer when studying the arts? Here we present a theoretical frame within which the concept of complementarity as a generative or creative principle is proposed; neurocognitive processes are characterized by the duality of complementary activities like bottom-up and top-down control, or logistical functions like temporal control and content functions like perceptions in the neural machinery. On that basis a thought pattern is suggested for aesthetic appreciations and cognitive appraisals in general. This thought pattern is deeply rooted in the history of philosophy and art theory since antiquity; and complementarity also characterizes neural operations as basis for cognitive processes. We then discuss some challenges one is confronted with in experimental aesthetics; in our opinion, one serious problem is the lack of a taxonomy of functions in psychology and neuroscience which is generally accepted. This deficit makes it next to impossible to develop acceptable models which are similar to what has to be modeled. Another problem is the severe language bias in this field of research as knowledge gained in many languages over the ages remains inaccessible to most scientists. Thus, an inspection of research results or theoretical concepts is necessarily too narrow. In spite of these limitations we provide a selective summary of some results and viewpoints with a focus on visual art and its appreciation. It is described how questions of art and aesthetic appreciations using behavioral methods and in particular brain-imaging techniques are analyzed and evaluated focusing on such issues like the representation of artwork or affective experiences. Finally, we emphasize complementarity as a generative principle on a practical level when artists and scientists work directly together which can lead to new insights and broader perspectives on both sides. © 2017 Bao, von Stosch, Park and Pöppel.","Brain imaging; Complementarity; Language bias; Modeling; Neuroaesthetics; Taxonomy of functions; Thought pattern; Visual art",,2-s2.0-85019651148

In light of the relatively low prevalence of DRDs, the large interindividual variation in the required l-dopa dose, the uncertainty about an adequate trial duration, the substantial advances in knowledge on etiology and pathophysiology of these disorders, and the availability of various state-of-the-art diagnostic tests, we think that a diagnostic l-dopa trial as a first step in the approach of early-onset dystonia (≤25 years) is outdated. Rather, in high-resource countries, we suggest to use l-dopa after biochemical corroboration of a defect in dopamine biosynthesis, in genetically confirmed DRD, or if nigrostriatal degeneration has been demonstrated by nuclear imaging in adult patients presenting with lower limb dystonia. Furthermore, our literature study on the effect of a therapeutic trial to gain symptomatic relief revealed that l-dopa has occasionally proven beneficial in several established ""non-DRDs"" and may therefore be considered in selected cases of dystonia due to other causes. In summary, we argue against the application of l-dopa in every patient with early-onset dystonia and support a more rational therapeutic use. © 2017 American Academy of Neurology.",,"DOPA; dopamine; antiparkinson agent; dopamine; levodopa; biosynthesis; clinical practice; diagnostic test; dopa responsive dystonia; drug approval; drug indication; dystonia; human; medical history; pathophysiology; prevalence; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; treatment duration; dystonia; metabolism; Anti-Dyskinesia Agents; Dopamine; Dystonia; Humans; Levodopa",2-s2.0-85019923784

When Perry Nodelman's Words about Pictures: the Narrative Art of Children's Picture Books was published almost three decades ago, it was greeted as an important contribution to studies in children's picture books and illustration internationally; and based substantially on it, Nodelman has recently been named the 2015 recipient of the International Grimm Award for children's literature criticism. In the years since Words About Pictures appeared, scholars have built on Nodelman's groundbreaking text and have developed a range of other approaches, both to picture books and to newer forms of visual/verbal texts that have entered the marketplace and become popular with young people. The essays in this book offer 'more words' about established and emerging forms of picture books, providing an overview of the current state of studies in visual/verbal texts and gathering in one place the work being produced at various locations and across disciplines. Essays exploring areas such as semiological and structural aspects of conventional picture books, graphic narratives and new media forms, and the material and performative cultures of picture books represent current work not only from literary studies but also media studies, art history, ecology, Middle Eastern Studies, library and information studies, and educational research. In addition to work by international scholars including William Moebius, Erica Hateley, Nathalie op de Beeck, and Nina Christensen that carries on and challenges the conclusions of Words about Pictures, the collection also includes a wide-ranging reflection by Perry Nodelman on continuities and changes in the current interdisciplinary field of study of visual/verbal texts for young readers.

Traditional predictive schemes are limited in their effectiveness by their inability to plan for the performance and energy characteristics of upcoming phases. To date, there has been little research exploring more proactive techniques that account for expected future behavior when making decisions. This paper proposes using Model Predictive Control (MPC) to attempt to maximize the energy efficiency of GPU kernels without compromising performance. We develop performance and power prediction models for a recent CPU-GPU heterogeneous processor. Our system then dynamically adjusts hardware states based on recent execution history, the pattern of upcoming kernels, and the predicted behavior of those kernels. We also dynamically trade off the performance overhead and the effectiveness of MPC in finding the best configuration by adapting the horizon length at runtime. Our MPC technique limits performance loss by proactively spending energy on the kernel iterations that will gain the most performance from that energy. This energy can then be recovered in future iterations that are less performance sensitive. Our scheme also avoids wasting energy on low-throughput phases when it foresees future high-throughput kernels that could better use that energy. Compared to state-of-the-practice schemes, our approach achieves 24.8% energy savings with a performance loss (including MPC overheads) of 1.8%. Compared to state-of-the-art history-based schemes, our approach achieves 6.6% chip-wide energy savings while simultaneously improving performance by 9.6%. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Computer architecture; Dynamic frequency scaling; Economic and social effects; Energy conservation; Graphics processing unit; Memory architecture; Model predictive control; Power management; Predictive control systems; Program processors; Supercomputers; Throughput; Voltage scaling; Adaptive model predictive control; Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling; Energy characteristics; Execution history; Heterogeneous processors; Improving performance; Power predictions; State of the practice; Energy efficiency",2-s2.0-85019546271

The art critic Ruskin has often been referred to in the context of the transition to self-expression in the history of art education. This article shows, however, that Ruskin was not an advocate of self-expression. In Japan, drawing was introduced into the general education curriculum at the beginning of the Meiji era, and the aim of that instruction was to train the students' eyes and hands. In response to this trend, the Free Drawing Movement was introduced by Kanae Yamamoto. He attempted to introduce the methods of creation used by professional artists into general education. But this aspect was neglected by both his supporters and opponents, and Yamamoto has been presented instead as an advocate of self-expression. Drawing on the genealogical approach, as developed by Foucault, this paper re-examines this well-known history of art education.

Yashin’s memory is notably being maintained in the public perception not least through the material form of two key sculptures erected in Moscow in the late 1990s. Yet these works, part of a wider international trend to memorialize footballers in the form of public monuments, offer more than a unique insight into Yashin’s career, status and reputation.

They argue that it is necessary, if we are to progress “social alternatives” in education, to construct micro-histories of schools that have developed as “real utopias” through radically revising their practice. They call these micro-histories “critical case studies of possibilities”. In To Hell with Culture (1963), the art educator and anarchist Herbert Read returned to a theme he had been exploring since the early 1930s - the purpose of education. For him, “education” implied many things, but he saw modern practice as “socially disintegrating”. Instead, Read offered an alternative to the dominant discourse about education under capitalism in the 1960s which would create “that collective consciousness which is the spiritual energy of a people and the only source of its art and culture”. To what extent was Read’s conception of education an ideal, a dream unfulfilled? Following Fielding and Moss this paper will seek to trace “critical case studies of possibilities” drawn from the past which reflect the fundamental connection identified by Read between school learning, “collective consciousness”, art, and culture. © 2017 Stichting Paedagogica Historica.","Art; Children; Collective consciousness; Culture; Learning",,2-s2.0-85012042904

There is also some evidence that artists may prefer compositions with key features on the right of the picture. Do these findings generalize to spontaneous, pseudo-artistic productions by individuals with no formal training in painting and art history? To investigate this issue, we tested a sample of 104 British schoolchildren and teenagers (mean age = 13.8 years; 80 females). We analysed posing biases in individual photographic self-portraits (“selfies”) as well as of self-portraits including also the portrait of a friend (“wefies”). Our results document a bias for showing the left cheek in selfies, a bias for placing the selfie-taker on the right in wefies, and a bias for showing two left cheeks over two right cheeks, again in wefies. These biases are reminiscent of what has been reported for selfies in adult non-artists and for portraits and self-portraits by artists in the 16th–18th centuries. Thus, these results provide new evidence in support of a biological basis for side biases in portraits and self-portraits independently of training and expertise. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","portraits; Self-portraits; selfies; side bias; wefies","adolescent; art; cheek; child; female; friend; hemispheric dominance; human; male; painting; photography; psychology; self concept; smartphone; United Kingdom; Adolescent; Cheek; Child; Female; Friends; Functional Laterality; Humans; Male; Paintings; Photography; Portraits as Topic; Self Concept; Smartphone; United Kingdom",2-s2.0-84969941166

Objective: We assessed long-term efficacy and safety of switching to co-formulated elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (E/C/F/TDF) from multi-tablet ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI + RTV) plus F/TDF (TVD) regimens. Methods: STRATEGY-PI was a 96-week, phase 3b, randomized (2:1), open-label, non-inferiority study examining the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of switching to E/C/F/TDF from PI + RTV + TVD regimens in virologically suppressed individuals (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL). Participants were randomized to switch to E/C/F/TDF (switch group) or to continue their PI + RTV + TVD regimens (no-switch group). Eligibility criteria included no resistance to F/TDF or history of virologic failure, and estimated creatinine clearance ≥70 mL/min. Results: At week 96, 87% (252/290) of switch and 70% (97/139) of no-switch participants maintained HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL (difference: 17%, 95% CI 8.7–26.0%, p < 0.001). Superiority of the switch to E/C/F/TDF vs. no-switch was due to a smaller proportion of both virologic failures (switch, 1% [3/290]; no-switch, 6% [8/139]) and discontinuations for non-virologic reasons (switch, 11% [31/290]; no-switch, 24% [33/139]). No treatment-emergent resistance was observed in switch subjects with virologic failure. Discontinuation rates from adverse events were 3% in both groups (9/293, switch; 4/140, no-switch). Switching from PI + RTV + TVD to E/C/F/TDF was associated with significant improvements in patient-reported outcomes related to gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea and bloating). Conclusion: E/C/F/TDF is a safe, effective long-term alternative to multi-tablet PI + RTV + TVD-based regimens in virologically suppressed, HIV-1-infected adults, and improves patient-reported gastrointestinal symptoms. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","HIV; INSTI; Patient-reported outcomes; Protease inhibitor; Randomized trial; Simplification; Single-tablet regimen; Superiority; Switch","alanine aminotransferase; antiretrovirus agent; atazanavir plus ritonavir; bilirubin; cobicistat plus elvitegravir plus emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil; creatine kinase; emtricitabine; gamma glutamyltransferase; proteinase inhibitor; ritonavir; tenofovir disoproxil; virus RNA; abnormal laboratory result; adult; alanine aminotransferase blood level; antiretroviral therapy; Article; backache; bilirubin blood level; bipolar disorder; bloating; coughing; creatine kinase blood level; depression; diarrhea; drug dosage form comparison; drug dose regimen; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug substitution; drug tolerability; drug withdrawal; female; gamma glutamyl transferase blood level; gastroenteritis; headache; hematuria; human; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; hyperbilirubinemia; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; myalgia; nausea; open study; patient compliance; patient-reported outcome; pharyngitis; phase 3 clinical trial; priority journal; randomization; rhinopharyngitis; single tablet regimen; suicide attempt; syphilis; tablet formulation; treatment outcome; upper respiratory tract infection; virus inhibition; virus load; virus suppression",2-s2.0-85019720662

Polish and Dutch groups and magazines belonged to an international, cross-border network of avant-garde writers, artists and architects who jointly struggled for new, modern art. Within this network, magazines and artists from Poland and the Netherlands were related to each other regardless of apparent cultural and linguistic boundaries – not only via other formations (e.g. French or German), but also directly based on personal contacts between particular representatives of given groups. These relationships enabled direct, mutual and reciprocal exchange of texts and reproductions of artworks and architectural projects between Polish and Dutch magazines. Based on such tangible traces, as well as private correspondence between the artists, I describe the history and the maelstroms of cultural exchange between Dutch and Polish avant-gardes, which – being part of the transnational European avant-garde network – significantly contributed to the development of modern literary, artistic and architectural thought. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Avant-garde; Constructivism; Cultural mobility; Little magazines; Polish–Dutch exchange",,2-s2.0-84978529090

We investigate the cost-effectiveness of various ART scale-up options in Uganda. Methods: Individual-based HIV/ART model of Uganda, calibrated using history matching. 22 ART scale-up strategies were simulated from 2016 to 2030, comprising different combinations of six single interventions (1. increased HIV testing rates, 2. no CD4 threshold for ART initiation, 3. improved ART retention, 4. increased ART restart rates, 5. improved linkage to care, 6. improved pre-ART care). The incremental net monetary benefit (NMB) of each intervention was calculated, for a wide range of different willingness/ability to pay (WTP) per DALY averted (health-service perspective, 3% discount rate). Results: For all WTP thresholds above $210, interventions including removing the CD4 threshold were likely to be most cost-effective. At a WTP of $715 (1×per-capita-GDP) interventions to improve linkage to and retention/re-enrolment in HIV care were highly likely to be more cost-effective than interventions to increase rates of HIV testing. At higher WTP (>~$1690), the most cost-effective option was 'Universal Test, Treat, and Keep' (UTTK), which combines interventions 1-5 detailed above. Conclusions: Our results support new WHO guidelines to remove the CD4 threshold for ART initiation in Uganda. With additional resources, this could be supplemented with interventions aimed at improving linkage to and/or retention in HIV care. To achieve the greatest reductions in HIV incidence, a UTTK policy should be implemented. © 2017 The Author(s).","ART; Cost-effectiveness; HIV; Mathematical modelling; Uganda; Universal test and treat","adult; aged; antiretroviral therapy; calibration; CD4 lymphocyte count; cost effectiveness analysis; female; health care access; health care cost; health care quality; HIV test; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; infection control; major clinical study; male; medication compliance; patient care; practice guideline; Review; simulation; Uganda; cost benefit analysis; economics; highly active antiretroviral therapy; HIV Infections; mass screening; procedures; quality adjusted life year; theoretical model; utilization; Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Male; Mass Screening; Models, Theoretical; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Uganda",2-s2.0-85018748781

The traditional concept of ""In-Sul"" (benevolent art) and the modern history of South Korea have led to cultural differences between South Korea and other countries in conceptualizing medical professionalism; thus, we studied medical students' perceptions of professionalism as described in essays written on this topic. Methods: In 2014, we asked 109 first-year medical students who were enrolled in a compulsory ethics course to anonymously write a description of an instance of medical professionalism that they had witnessed, as well as reflecting on their own professional context. We then processed 105 valid essays using thematic content analysis with computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software. Results: Thematic analysis of the students' essays revealed two core aspects of professionalism in South Korea, one focused on respect for patients and the other on physicians' accountability. The most common theme regarding physician-patient relationships was trust. By contrast, distributive justice was thought to be a non-essential aspect of professionalism. Conclusions: In Western countries, physicians tend to promote justice in the health care system, including fair distribution of medical resources; however, we found that medical students in South Korea were more inclined to emphasize doctors' relationships with patients. Medical educators should develop curricular interventions regarding medical professionalism to meet the legitimate needs of patients in their own culture. Because professionalism is a dynamic construct of culture, medical educators should reaffirm cultural context-specific definitions of professionalism for development of associated curricula. © 2017 The Author(s).","Cultural differences; Curriculum development; Korea; Medical education; Medical students; Professionalism","content analysis; curriculum development; data analysis software; doctor patient relation; ethics; health care system; human; human experiment; justice; medical education; medical student; perception; professionalism; South Korea; thematic analysis; thinking; trust",2-s2.0-85018992498

In her life and work she set new standards in piano playing. However, her career was beset by poor health and the adversities of two world wars. In her lifetime Haskil had three major disorders: juvenile scoliosis requiring treatment in her adolescence, a tumor of the sellar region requiring surgery at age 47 years, and a traumatic brain injury causing her death at the age of 65. Her medical history illustrates the development of surgical methods and rehabilitation in medicine before and after World War II. At an early age, she spent a year in a nursing home for orthopedic diseases due to scoliosis. In 1942, when she was 47 years old, she displayed the first symptoms of a suprasellar brain tumor: headache and hemianopsia. The famous surgeon Marcel David performed surgery on her without general anesthesia while Haskil mentally played a Mozart piano concerto as a neuronal representation to control her memory and mental abilities. Only 3 months after that operation she played a Mozart piano concerto at a concert that began her career as a great interpreter of Mozart. Her neurologic rehabilitation was remarkable and highlighted new methods in the field. In 1960, she traveled to Brussels for a concert. In the train station she stumbled on the stairs and hit her head on one of the steps. Skull fracture and intracranial hematoma were diagnosed. Doctors tried to operate on her but she lost consciousness and died. Haskil created new styles in piano playing, and her medical history offers indications of new concepts in neurosurgery. © Georg Thieme Verlag KGStuttgart · New York.","awake craniotomy; history of neurosurgery; pianist; suprasellar meningioma; traumatic brain injury","Article; brain damage; brain hemorrhage; craniopharyngioma; craniotomy; differential diagnosis; haskil congenital scoliosis; haskil intracranial lesion; human; hypophysis tumor; local anesthesia; medical history; meningioma; music therapy; pianist; Rathke cleft cyst; scoliosis; skull fracture; traumatic brain injury; tumor diagnosis; art; Brain Neoplasms; craniotomy; female; France; history; music; procedures; public figure; Romania; sella turcica; wakefulness; Brain Neoplasms; Craniotomy; Famous Persons; Female; France; History, 20th Century; Humans; Music; Romania; Sella Turcica; Wakefulness",2-s2.0-85013414467

Pischinger was an illegal NSDAP member in Austria, joined the SA in 1938, served as expert in racial hygiene, and as judge on the Genetic Health High Court of Graz. His research focus was histochemistry, but he became part of a scientific network at the University of Graz, which from 1939 on experimented on the bodies of pregnant women and their fetuses under the leadership of gynecologist Karl Ehrhardt. The researchers were among the many who took actively part in the complete exploitation and physical destruction of those considered to be “the enemy” by the NS regime. After the war, Pischinger received publicity for his work on the “scientific basis” of alternative and holistic approaches of medicine. His NS past and fetal experiments seem to have vanished from public knowledge. As systematic studies of the influence of the NS period on postwar medical education and the science of anatomy itself are still missing, this critical investigation of Alfred Pischinger's life within the relevant historic background aims to contribute to this body of knowledge. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","Alfred Pischinger; Anatomy in National Socialism; Bodies of the executed; Ethics of anatomy; Human experimentation; Karl Ehrhardt; University of Graz","anatomy; Austria; career; court; destruction; embryology; ethics; female; fetus; gynecologist; histochemistry; human; human experiment; human tissue; hygiene; leadership; male; mass medium; medical education; medicine; national socialism; pregnant woman; scientist; university; art; cytochemistry; gynecology; history; medical genetics; national socialism; Austria; Embryology; Eugenics; Gynecology; Histocytochemistry; History, 20th Century; Human Experimentation; National Socialism",2-s2.0-85014419641

The 1918 standard (1) established medical staff organizations in hospitals; (2) restricted membership to licensed practitioners in good standing; (3) mandated that the medical staff work with hospital administration to develop and adopt regulations and policies governing their professional work; (4) required standardized, accessible medical records; and (5) required availability of diagnostic and therapeutic facilities. One hundred years ago, these were radical expectations. Objectives: To describe the origin, ""marketing"", and voluntary adoption of the 1918 standards, and to describe how the evolution of those standards profoundly affected laboratory medicine after 1926. Design: Available primary and secondary historical sources were reviewed. Results: The college had no legal mandate, so it used a highly consultative approach, funded by its membership and the Carnegie Foundation (New York, New York), to establish the Minimum Standards, followed by a non-threatening mechanism to determine which hospitals met them. Simultaneously, the college educated the public to fuel their expectations. Compliance by more than 100-bed hospitals in the United States and Canada, although entirely voluntary, rose from negligible when first implemented in 1918 to more than 90% in only a few years. From 1922 to 1926, the American Society for Clinical Pathology (Chicago, Illinois) worked creatively with the college to establish Minimum Standards for ""adequate"" laboratory services. Conclusions: The birth and implementation of this program exemplifies how a consultative approach with full engagement of grassroots stakeholders facilitated a voluntary, rapid, sweeping North America-wide change-management process. This program eventually evolved into the Joint Commission (Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois).",,"adoption; Canada; change management; college; expectation; hospital; human; Illinois; joint; marketing; medicine; New York; pathology; surgeon; art; history; hospital; laboratory; medical society; standards; United States; American Medical Association; History, 20th Century; Hospitals; Humans; Laboratories; Pathology, Clinical; Pathology, Surgical; United States",2-s2.0-85018317551

With the proliferation of RFID-enabled applications, multiple readers are needed for ensuring the full coverage of numerous RFID tags. In this paper, we focus on the tag distribution problem in multi-reader RFID systems. The problem is to fast identify the tag set beneath each reader, which is a fundamental premise of efficient product inventory and management. Only with such tag set information can we localize specific tags in a reader and expedite the tag query information collection. As an RFID system usually contains a large number of tags and multiple readers, the traditional solution to identify tags by individual readers is highly time inefficient. We propose an Inference-Based protocol (IB) that identifies the tag distribution based on information inference rules and the aggregated physical signals to improve operational efficiency. In our protocol, three kinds of inference rules based on internal information reported by a single reader, external information shared by multiple readers, and history information retained by the system are fully exploited to infer tag distribution. With these rules, all readers can cooperatively work together and quickly obtain the tag distribution in the system. We also build a prototype RFID system using the USRP-based reader and WISP programmable tags, and then implement the IB protocol. The experimental results and extended simulations show that IB outperforms the state-of-the-art protocols. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","multiple readers; RFID system; tag distribution identification; time efficiency; topological relations","Efficiency; Monitoring and tracking; multiple readers; Operational efficiencies; Revolutionary changes; RFID systems; State-of-the art protocols; Time efficiencies; Topological relations; Radio frequency identification (RFID)",2-s2.0-85017366402

Many HIV-associated oral infections occur early in HIV disease, not infrequently as the presenting sign or symptom. Thus, early detection of the associated oral opportunistic infections should, in many cases, result in earlier diagnosis of HIV infection. Cytology, a simple, painless, and inexpensive method, has become a preferred method and was used in our study for early diagnosis of certain lesions. To determine the effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy on incidence rate of opportunistic infections among HIV-positive adults in a teaching hospital in India, a prospective study was conducted and the required sample size was 40. Study participants were selected randomly from the outpatient department of an HIV clinic who were currently on for antiretroviral therapy (ART). Data on age, gender, form of contagion, antiretroviral therapy at the time of review, number of CD4 lymphocytes per milliliter, and viral load were collected. Oral cytologic investigation was carried out and then stained for histopathological examination. A total of 40 individuals were examined and the incidence of opportunistic infections was 66.7% in individuals with CD4 counts less than 200, 55.6% in individuals with CD4 counts of 200 to 499, and 40.0% in individuals with CD4 counts more than 500.

After over a century of investigations, the cause(s) at the origin of this uniqueness are not yet clear. The shorter stature of Sardinians appears to have been documented since prehistoric times, as revealed by the analysis of skeletal remains discovered in archaeological sites on the island. Recently, a number of genetic, hormonal, environmental, infective and nutritional factors have been put forward to explain this unique anthropometric feature, which persisted for a long time, even when environmental and living conditions improved around 1960. Although some of the putative factors are supported by sound empirical evidence, weaker support is available for others. The recent advent of whole genome analysis techniques shed new light on specific variants at the origin of this short stature. However, the marked geographical variability of stature across time and space within the island, and the well-known presence of pockets of short height in the population of the southern districts, are still puzzling findings that have attracted the interest of anthropologists and geneticists.

This report provides a resource for clinicians managing HIV-infected patients and ART in the inpatient setting. Methods: A survey of the authors was conducted to evaluate common issues that arise during an acute hospitalization for HIV-infected patients. After a group consensus, a review of the medical literature was performed to determine the supporting evidence for the following HIV-associated hospital queries: admission/discharge orders, antiretroviral hospital formularies, laboratory monitoring, altered hepatic/renal function, drug-drug interactions (DDIs), enteral administration, and therapeutic drug monitoring. Results: With any hospital admission for an HIV-infected patient, a specific set of procedures should be followed including a thorough admission medication history and communication with the ambulatory HIV provider to avoid omissions or substitutions in the ART regimen. DDIs are common and should be reviewed at all transitions of care during the hospital admission. ART may be continued if enteral nutrition with a feeding tube is deemed necessary, but the entire regimen should be discontinued if no oral access is available for a prolonged period. Therapeutic drug monitoring is not generally recommended but, if available, should be considered in unique clinical scenarios where antiretroviral pharmacokinetics are difficult to predict. ART may need adjustment if hepatic or renal insufficiency ensues. Conclusions: Treatment of hospitalized patients with HIV is highly complex. HIV-infected patients are at high risk for medication errors during various transitions of care. Baseline knowledge of the principles of antiretroviral pharmacotherapy is necessary for clinicians managing acutely ill HIV-infected patients to avoid medication errors, identify DDIs, and correctly dose medications if organ dysfunction arises.

Through a case study of Angola, I explore if and how the prison’s plantation history is acknowledged at the prison rodeo and arts and crafts festival, commemorated in museum exhibits, and discussed in prisoner writings. My analysis reveals the contested nature of Angola’s history and the place of slavery (and racial inequality more generally) in it. In an act of racial violence, the administration tells a story of progress that disregards slavery along with its parallels to the present. On the other hand, some prisoners resist this narrative and evoke memories of slavery in protest of their current circumstances. I conclude with a discussion of what this struggle over Angola’s, and the nation’s, history might mean for the prospect of penal reform. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Cultural criminology; penal tourism; racial inequality; racial violence; slavery",,2-s2.0-85018788872

The present study was thus designed to monitor and explore the pattern of occurrence of ADRs to various antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens in a tertiary care ART setup. Materials and Methods: A prospective, observational clinical study was carried out in the outpatient setting of nodal ART center of Eastern India. A total of 610 patients on various ART regimens were studied for suspected ADRs over 12 months. Adverse event history, medication history, and other relevant details were captured. Causality and severity of each reported ADR were duly assessed. Results: 32.45% patients of total study participants presented with a total of 330 ADRs. Patients from zidovudine-based regimens presented with majority of ADRs such as anemia (up to 36%), central nervous system (CNS), and gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. Tenofovir-based regimens were, however, found to be mildly safer. The combination with Efavirenz was associated with majorly CNS side effects while that of nevirapine was associated with rash and pigmentation of nails. Atazanavir boosted second-line regimens were notably associated with increased serum lipid levels followed by other GI and CNS adverse effects. Increased liver enzymes were found in atazanavir-based second-line ART. Conclusion: The study enables to obtain information on the incidence and pattern of ADRs associated with various antiretroviral regimens, thereby reducing its occurrence and protecting the patient population from avoidable harm. Need of intensive monitoring for ADRs in ARTs thus seems to be a mandate.","Adverse drug reactions; antiretroviral therapy regimens; human immunodeficiency virus",,2-s2.0-85030159152

His contact with the classics and the universe of picturesque travels marked his artistic production. The few pieces of his work that have survived show this artist's connection to the culture of the Grand Tour as well as his Romantic sensibility. Furthermore, what he learned in Italy familiarized this Brazilian artist with the values and methods discussed in the antiquarian and erudite environments of the era. It is thanks to this experience that Porto-Alegre some years later interpreted the history of Brazilian art inspired by readings of authors such as Johann J. Winckelmann and Luigi Lanzi. Finally, this article also defends that Porto-Alegre's time in Italy was a symbolic passport among the scholars of the Institut Historique of Paris as well as the Instituto Histórico Brasileiro.

For this policy of a 'treat all' to succeed, millions of new patients must be initiated on ART as efficiently as possible. Studies have documented high losses of treatment-eligible patients from care before they receive their first dose of antiretrovirals (ARVs), due in part to a cumbersome, resource-intensive process for treatment initiation, requiring multiple clinic visits over a several-week period. Methods and analysis The Simplified Algorithm for Treatment Eligibility (SLATE) study is an individually randomised evaluation of a simplified clinical algorithm for clinicians to reliably determine a patient's eligibility for immediate ART initiation without waiting for laboratory results or additional clinic visits. SLATE will enrol and randomise (1:1) 960 adult, HIV-positive patients who present for HIV testing or care and are not yet on ART in South Africa and Kenya. Patients randomised to the standard arm will receive routine, standard of care ART initiation from clinic staff. Patients randomised to the intervention arm will be administered a symptom report, medical history, brief physical exam and readiness assessment. Patients who have positive (satisfactory) results for all four components of SLATE will be dispensed ARVs immediately, at the same clinic visit. Patients who have any negative results will be referred for further clinical investigation, counselling, tests or other services prior to being dispensed ARVs. After the initial visit, follow-up will be by passive medical record review. The primary outcomes will be ART initiation ≤28 days and retention in care 8 months after study enrolment.

While contemporary education tends to stress the conveying of knowledge and skills needed to succeed in the present-day information society, the present article turns to the work of Theodor W. Adorno to develop alternative thinking about education, thinking and the political significance of education for thinking. Adorno touched upon educational questions throughout his writings, with growing interest in the last ten years of his life. Education, he argues following Kant, must enable students to think for themselves and to break free of the authority of teachers, parents and other adults. Nevertheless, in his discussions of education Adorno says little about the nature of thinking, and the secondary literature on his educational theory addresses this question only cursorily. Important claims on the nature of thinking do appear elsewhere in Adorno's work. From his early writings up to Negative Dialectics, Adorno is preoccupied with thinking, sketching the outlines of critical-dialectical thought. Still, these reflections rarely touch upon educational questions, and the Adorno scholarship has yet to establish this link. Unlike studies which read Adorno's educational thought against the backdrop of the history of education and the German Bildung tradition, or in relation to art and aesthetics, the present article brings together Adorno's ideas on education and thinking in an attempt to contribute both to the Adorno scholarship and to the growing field of education for thinking. © 2017 The Philosophy of Education Society of Great Britain.",,,2-s2.0-85017585377

'The freelancer' to quote Lauren Berlant (76) 'is one of the sovereign figures of neoliberalism'.1 Looking beyond dance's unwitting complicity in the neoliberal contracting of the body, this paper focuses on dance as an emergent critical aesthetics that calls attention to the incorporation of the geopolitical by the post-statist neoliberal project. Its case study is Maleficent (2014), the Angelina Jolie popular cinema radical retelling, as prequel, of the back story of Sleeping Beauty's slighted fairy Carabosse. Maleficent's status as dance intertext is many-faceted: its titular character's conjunction of malevolence and magnificence and the sourcing of her predicament to an originating act of socio-economic disenfranchisement are familiar from the characterisation of Carabosse in Marius Petipa's choreography for the ballet The Sleeping Beauty (1890). Unspecified in the ballet, this act is elaborated in the film: 'the winged creature who rose to be protector of The Moors, a kingdom which needed neither king nor queen' to quote the film's narration, Maleficent is shorn of her wings in an act of land-grab motivated premeditated human interspecies violence. This act, betokening rape for Jolie, renders Maleficent's aerial choreographic spectacle pedestrianised; everyday and earthbound, just as Carabosse, denied vertiginous danse d'école vocabularies, must substitute more mundane mime in their place. This paper begins by establishing the strong bonds which bind Disney to dance; the extent to which, to quote Soviet avant-garde filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein, 'the art of animation⋯ has its forerunner in ballet⋯ At least in Fokine's ballets for Diaghilev⋯'.2 Drawing on analyses of neoliberalism, those of David Harvey in particular, this paper then moves to consider Maleficent as the articulation of a critique of neoliberalism, one which - it will be suggested - relies heavily on Cynic philosophy for its formulation. Cynic philosophy, especially in the extended consideration of the Cynic life presented by Michel Foucault's final series of Collège de France lectures3 will be critically important here. Arguing for Maleficent as the choreography of Feminist ethics in response to neoliberal policies that render human relations to the land ever more ethno-biologically precarious, this paper will point up the strong parallels that exist between the film and Cynic thinking. In Foucault's account, Cynicism especially prioritises the vie autre (other life). This makes Cynicism particularly effective as a vehicle for questioning neoliberal values and proposing others in their place. Maleficent's critique will be shown to be choreo-philosophical in the sense that it mobilises, and is highly reliant upon, a range of dance histories - those to do with The Sleeping Beauty especially - and dance practices, particularly those bound up, ultimately, with pantomime dance in Hellenistic ancient Greece. This article will suggest that pantomime dance as a close, cognate ally of Cynic philosophy, was already imbued, in some significant sense, with philosophical intent. It is pantomime dance's philosophical intent - this paper argues - that endures and is mobilised to such effect in the roles of Carabosse and Maleficent. Attention then turns to Alain Badiou's concept of cinema as philosophy. This article will suggest both that Badiou's concept is more indebted to dance than is generally acknowledged, and that it arguably strengthens the sorts of claims that can be made for Maleficent as choreo-philosophical critique. This paper also proposes, in a similar vein, that on the basis of his reading of Cynicism as actually highly motile, the late Foucault is more phenomenological in orientation and - so it would follow - less antithetical to dance and its study, than has hitherto been suggested. © 2017 Society for Dance Research.","Alain Badiou; Carabosse; Charles Perrault; Cynic philosophy; David Harvey; Disney animation; Enclosure; Gender politics; Land grab; Maleficent; Michel Foucault; Neoliberalism; Pantomime dance; Pedestrianism; Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky; The sleeping beauty (ballet)",,2-s2.0-85020765804

It was dominated by the larger-than-life figure of Stan Hugill, a former shantyman who ensured the continuation of this musical tradition through his performances and books. But in fact, as shanty authority the late Roy Palmer has pointed out, the idea of reviving a dying art had been a concern by the end of the nineteenth century. Following this, folk-song collectors like Cecil Sharp made concerted efforts to document shanties but also to make adaptations (such as censoring the lyrics and providing piano accompaniments) to enable them to be performed on land - even on the concert platform - by those who had little or no direct experience of seafaring. Although this seems to be the complete opposite to Hugill's approach of connecting the songs with their traditional maritime context, both aimed to ensure that shanties remained relevant. This article considers the continuation of these attitudes to the shanty in the twenty-first century. The recent resurgence in shanty singing in the UK has taken place alongside the regeneration of many UK port areas, the (re-)development of sailortowns as contemporary tourist destinations and associated attempts to connect the public with maritime heritage. I will focus in particular on the Falmouth (Cornwall) International Sea Shanty Festival, exploring the aims and motivations of different performing groups and analysing their contemporary approaches to music which is inextricably linked with seafaring history. © 2017 International Maritime Economic History Association.","Falmouth; folk song; music festivals; shanty",,2-s2.0-85019588052

This article briefly introduces readers to the history and theory of rhetoric for two purposes: (1) explaining the various and sometimes contradictory ways in which this ancient discipline shapes the communication of climate science and (2) providing readers with a few simple but powerful tools for coping with climate debates.

The proposed setup enables the forces acting on the section model to be measured directly while considering motions that resemble actual bridge motion and still fully utilizing the benefits of the forced vibration testing technique. The excellent performance of the system and testing procedure is proved by performing state-of-the-art forced vibration tests to extract 18 flutter derivatives of the Hardanger Bridge cross-section. The new experimental setup is further used to simulate a three-degree-of-freedom dynamic system driven by white noise to investigate whether the estimates of the aerodynamic derivatives are sensitive to the motion considered.

However, scalability brings challenges of drift in pose estimation, introducing significant errors in the accumulated model. Approaches often require hours of offline processing to globally correct model errors. Recent online methods demonstrate compelling results but suffer from (1) needing minutes to perform online correction, preventing true real-time use; (2) brittle frame-to-frame (or frame-to-model) pose estimation, resulting in many tracking failures; or (3) supporting only unstructured point-based representations, which limit scan quality and applicability. We systematically address these issues with a novel, real-time, end-to-end reconstruction framework. At its core is a robust pose estimation strategy, optimizing per frame for a global set of camera poses by considering the complete history of RGB-D input with an efficient hierarchical approach. We remove the heavy reliance on temporal tracking and continually localize to the globally optimized frames instead. We contribute a parallelizable optimization framework, which employs correspondences based on sparse features and dense geometric and photometric matching. Our approach estimates globally optimized (i.e., bundle adjusted) poses in real time, supports robust trackingwith recovery from gross tracking failures (i.e., relocalization), and re-estimates the 3D model in real time to ensure global consistency, all within a single framework. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art online systems with quality on par to offline methods, but with unprecedented speed and scan completeness. Our framework leads to a comprehensive online scanning solution for large indoor environments, enabling ease of use and high-quality results. © 2017 ACM.","Global consistency; Real-time; RGB-D; Scalable; Scan","Communication channels (information theory); Network function virtualization; Virtual reality; Global consistency; Hierarchical approach; Optimization framework; Point based representation; Real time; Reconstruction frameworks; Scalable; Scan; Online systems",2-s2.0-85018991728

Energy and output were tracked using monitor chamber signal, onboard megavoltage computed tomography (MVCT) detector profile, and external ion chamber measurements. The systems (and monitoring periods) include three Hi-Art (67, 61, and 65 mos.), two TomoHDA (31 and 26 mos.), and one Radixact unit (11 mos.), representing approximately 10 years of clinical use. The four newest systems use the Dose Control Stability (DCS) system and Fixed Target Linear Accelerator (linac) (FTL). The output stability is reported as deviation from reference monitor chamber signal for all systems and/or from an external chamber signal. The energy stability was monitored using relative (center versus off-axis) MVCT detector signal (beam profile) and/or the ratio of chamber measurements at 2 depths. The clinical TomoHDA data were used to benchmark the Radixact stability, which has the same FTL but runs at a higher dose rate. The output based on monitor chamber data of all systems is very stable. The standard deviation of daily output on the non-DCS systems was 0.94-1.52%. As expected, the DCS systems had improved standard deviation: 0.004-0.06%. The beam energy was also very stable for all units. The standard deviation in profile flatness was 0.23-0.62% for rotating target systems and 0.04-0.09% for FTL. Ion chamber output and PDD ratios supported these results. The output stability on the Radixact system during extended treatment delivery (20, 30, and 40 min) was comparable to a clinical TomoHDA system. For each system, results are consistent between different measurement tools and techniques, proving not only the dosimetric stability, but also these quality parameters can be confirmed with various metrics.

The aim of the process is to encourage persons weakened by their social and delinquent situations to elaborate, plan and realize new personal goals. Methodology With the collaboration of the service de l'application des peines de Tours (service for the execution of sentences), the service pénitentiaire d'insertion et de probation 37 (probation and social reintegration service) and the service d'aide aux victimes d'infractions pénales (association for victims of crime) of the French department 37, centre, the program PARIS attempted an implementation and evaluation of the relational or restorative justice process in the context of non-custodial sentences and in particular in the cases of aggravated theft (art. 311-1 to 311-16 of the French penal code). Its particularity was to touch the three spheres of victimization: (1) financial, (2) physical and (3) psychological prejudices. After the admission of the participants, a preliminary (psycho)criminological diagnosis served to evaluate the suitability for the perpetrator and the victim to be confronted in following settings. In this context we met Louis, a recidivist of aggravated thefts but causing minimal harm and punished with minimal sentences. He presented no mental illness but showed severe existential problems involved in his delinquent behaviour. His delinquent acts presented similarities marked by auto-punitive tendencies. For example, he remained on site until being arrested and joked with the police. Results The case Louis revealed what neither the care nor repression succeeded to reach, namely the quality of the relationship which can in itself confine or on the contrary repair. Relational Justice, by seeking neither to “suppress” nor to “care”, allows the participants to reconstruct and understand the other with empathy, and strengthened the protective factors. Mediation as a method or purpose held a prominent place in the reconstruction process of the participants as it allowed us to act on both the “frame” (scenario of the problem-situation) and the “drama” ((non)-effectiveness of cognitive strategies and experienced emotions) of the original problem-situation. So the restorative program was an alternative to the socio-judicial measures inducing potential therapeutic effects on the future path of the participant. Conclusion If the question of the relevance of direct, or perhaps better indirect, confrontations between the author and the victim still remains the (psycho-)criminological diagnosis of the penal couple's – author and victim – relationship investigates the psychosocial and delinquent process in terms of motivation. A satisfaction survey at the end of the program helps to analyse the future prospects of the participants. Based on dynamic and structured methods, the PARIS relational Justice program offers a Third Way between care and punishment: restoration of existential and relational links. © 2016 L'Encéphale, Paris","Aggravated theft; Author–victim relationship; Protective factors; Psycho-criminological diagnosis; Relational justice","Article; criminal behavior; criminal justice; defense mechanism; delinquency; empathy; futurology; human; justice; offender; protection; punishment; recidivism; restorative justice; theft; therapy effect; victim",2-s2.0-84969584517

This article is the result of an examination of a sutra box in the collection of the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam (hereafter ‘Rijksmuseum sutra box’), which was first introduced to a European audience in the Transactions and Proceedings of the Japanese Society, in 1913–1914. The Rijksmuseum sutra box differs from other Goryeo sutra boxes. With its altered structure and modified motifs, this box bears significant value, not only for the research of thirteenth-century Goryeo mother-of-pearl art, but also for the study of cross-cultural adaptations in East Asian lacquer art. This article investigates the date of manufacture of the sutra box by analysing the manufacturing techniques and its various original and modified parts. For this, an X-ray radiograph was carried out for the first time. As a result, discoveries have been made regarding the structure and decoration of the lower part, which has been modified and is different from Goryeo mother-of-pearl sutra boxes.

There are many reasons to pay closer attention to the Norwegian case when it comes to analyses of changes in the public sphere. In the country's political history, the arts and the media played a particular role in the processes towards sovereignty at the beginning of the 20th century. On a par with the other Scandinavian countries, Norway is in the forefront in the world in the distribution and uses of Internet technology. As an extreme case, the most corporatist society within the family of the ""Nordic Model"", it offers an opportunity both for intriguing case studies and for challenging and refining existing theory on processes of institutional change in media policy and cultural policy. It supplements two recent, important books on political economy in Scandinavia: Varieties of Liberalization and the New Politics of Social Solidarity (Kathleen Thelen, 2014), and The Political Construction of Business Interests (Cathie Jo Martin and Duane Swank, 2013). There are further reasons to pay particular attention to the Scandinavian, and more specifically the Norwegian cases: (i) They are to varying degrees neo-corporatist societies, characterized by ongoing bargaining over social and political reform processes. From a theoretical perspective this invites reflections which, to some extent, are at odds with the dominant conceptions of institutional change. Neither models of path dependency nor models of aggregate, incremental change focus on the continuous social bargaining over institutional change. (ii) Despite recent processes of liberalization, common to the Western world as a whole, corporatism implies a close connection between state, public sphere, cultural life, and religion. This also means that institutions are closely bundled, in an even stronger way than assumed for example in the Varieties of Capitalism literature. Furthermore, we only have scarce insight in the way the different spheres of corporatism are connected and interact. In the proposed edited volume we have collected historical-institutional case studies from a broad set of social fields (a detailed outline of contents and contributors is attached): • Critical assessments of Jürgen Habermas' theory of the public sphere • Can the public sphere be considered an institution? • The central position of the public sphere in social and political change in Norway • Digital transformations and effects of the growing PR industry on the public sphere • Institutionalization of social media in local politics and voluntary organizations • Legitimation work in the public sphere • freedom of expression and warning in the workplace • ""Return of religion"" to the public sphere, and its effects © 2017 Fredrik Engelstad, Håkon Larsen, Jon Rogstad, Kari Steen-Johnsen.",,,2-s2.0-85021282575

Here, a detailed analysis of the evolution of industrial hygiene practices regarding asbestos and its health risks, from the early 1900s until the advent of the national occupational health and safety regulatory structure currently in place in the US (early-to-mid 1970s) is presented. While industrial hygienists recognized in the early 1900s that chronic and high-level exposures to airborne concentrations of asbestos could pose a serious health hazard, it was not until the mid-1950s that the carcinogenic nature of asbestos began to be characterized and widespread concern followed. With the introduction of the membrane filter sampling method in the late 1960s and early 1970s, asbestos sampling and exposure assessment capabilities advanced to a degree which allowed industrial hygienists to more precisely characterize the exposure–response relationship. The ability of industrial hygienists, analytical chemists, toxicologists, and physicians to more accurately define this relationship was instrumental to the scientific community’s ability to establish Occupational Exposure Levels (OELs) for asbestos. These early developments set the stage for decades of additional study on asbestos exposure potential and risk of disease. This was followed by the application of engineering controls and improved respiratory protection which, over the years, saved thousands of lives.

So far, coherent forward scattering has not been observed in conservative systems with elastic scattering by spatial disorder. We propose to turn to the quantum kicked rotor, which has a long and successful history as an accurate experimental platform to observe dynamical localization, i.e., Anderson localization in momentum space.

However, to make this data easily accessible the scanned documents need to be transformed into search-able text. State of the art OCR systems using Long-Short-Term-Memory networks (LSTM) have been applied successfully to recognize text in both printed and handwritten form. Besides the general challenges with historical documents, e.g. poor image quality, damaged characters, etc., especially unknown scripts and old fonds make it difficult to provide the large amount of transcribed training data required for these methods to perform well. Transcribing the documents manually is very costly in terms of man-hours and require language specific expertise. The unknown fonds and requirement for meaningful context also make the use of synthetic data unfeasible. We therefore propose an end-to-end framework anyOCR that cuts the required input from language experts to a minimum and is therefore easily extendable to other documents.

The first approach is a detection based algorithm while the second is a data driven method. Our first contribution is a new tracking-by-detection strategy extending the CNN based single frame detection method to a multiple frame tracking approach by taking into account prediction history using RNN. Our second contribution is the use of RNN to simulate the fitting of a 3D model to the input data. It helps to relax the need of a carefully designed fitting function and optimization algorithm. With such strategies, we show that our tracking frameworks can automatically correct the fail detection made in previous frames due to occlusions. Our proposed method is evaluated on two public hand datasets, i.e. NYU and ICVL, and compared against other recent hand tracking methods. Experimental results show that our approaches achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency in the challenging problem of 3D hand pose estimation. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Gesture recognition; Optimization; Pattern recognition; Recurrent neural networks; 3D hand pose estimations; Convolution neural network; Data-driven methods; Fitting functions; Optimization algorithms; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Tracking approaches; Tracking by detections; Palmprint recognition",2-s2.0-85019108821

Examining this photograph in its historical context, it analyzes the unique encounter between Cameron, an upper-middle-class Anglo-Indian photographer, and her female model-subject, who came from the English lower classes. Whereas Cameron's biography is well researched and her artistic endeavors are fully acknowledged, the information on the photographed model, Annie Keene, is scarce. This article aims to reconstruct the model's life story. To fill the holes in the archival record, fiction is used to tell a detailed story of the unique professional meeting between Cameron and her sitter.

This raises the question: can performance itself be considered historical knowledge? This article pursues this question through the work of Stuart Brisley, the English multi-media artist well-known for his durational works from the late 1960s, some of which were also feats of physical endurance. Brisley’s oeuvre engages with a number of historical conflicts. It also radically questions the authenticity of the live event and its primacy in our understanding of both performance art and history. Drawing on unpublished testimony, this article considers the uses of history in Brisley’s work, focusing on the French Revolution. In particular, it assesses Brisley’s use of the 10-day week of the French revolutionary calendar as a durational framework for a series of works from the early 1970s to the present. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","chronology; duration; French revolutionary calendar; history; live art; performance; Stuart Brisley",,2-s2.0-85008410736

Consideration of his salon criticism reveals that questions of mimesis and imitation are fundamental to an understanding of his views on painting and to the destination of art in eighteenth-century France. Whether his objections are addressed to artists who failed to “follow the poet,” or to those who (in his view) neglected nature, Diderot’s frequently censorious remarks invariably revolve around issues that found their most developed expression in the humanistic theory of painting. As a result, his criticism raises questions about the continuing viability of a hierarchy of genres that placed grand narrative painting at its apex, and treated the minor genres as subordinate parerga to “le grand genre” of history painting. Seeking an accommodation for these “lesser” genres, Diderot developed critical concepts that sought to treat genre painting with the same seriousness as subjects drawn from mythology and the Bible, and led to his suggestion for an intermediate genre to reconcile these conflicts that he called, in his writings on drama, “le genre sérieux.” Diderot’s suggestion leads ineluctably to his advocacy for the work of Jean-Baptiste Greuze and Jean-Baptiste Chardin, whose domestic interiors and dead game were, for him, less an imitation of nature than a recreation of nature itself. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","Art criticism; genre painting; hierarchy of genres; history painting; subject matter; verisimilitude",,2-s2.0-85021317803

In all of these, Kac and his scientific collaborators realize genetic interventions into living organisms at the same time as they trigger audience reactions to these from playful kinds of interaction that is integrated into the works’ open and dynamic creative process. Yet whereas the ethical and political challenges Kac’s work poses have sparked lively debates within and beyond the realm of the arts–can and must art engage with the ‘creative’ potentials of biotechnology and genetics? Do these not in fact (as Vilém Flusser and others have suggested) hold the key to realizing the vanguardist dream of merging art and life? Or should the artist, from the vantage point of his own creative practice, not rather warn us against the ethical and political risks involved in genetic engineering?–much less attention has been paid to the way Kac’s art also continues and transforms a particular legacy of post-concretist, ambient and performance art in Latin America. Kac himself has referred to Brazilian artists Flávio de Carvalho, Hélio Oiticica and Lygia Clark as informing his interest in open, participative forms, which characterize both his transgenic and his earlier ‘tele-presence’ art projects. Other Latin American artists of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century have been producing intriguing engagements with living materials, multispecies habitats and organic remains, including such diverse names as Luis Fernando Benedit, Nicola Constantino, Nuno Ramos, or Teresa Margolles. In a conversation with Jens Andermann and Gabriel Giorgi at the University of Zurich’s Center of Latin American Studies on March 12, 2015, Kac addressed the way in which his work might be seen as continuing or challenging long-standing representations of the New World as a repository of ‘nature’, from colonial chronicles of discovery to contemporary discourses of biodiversity and conservation.

He only constructed the first widely known and used mechanism replacing the drawboy by punched cards to feed pattern information into his mechanism. To control a weave means to decide whether a warp thread is to be picked up or not. Weaving has therefore been a binary art from its very beginning, applying operations of pattern algebra for millennia. Jacquard’s cards were the end of this story rather than its beginning, reducing the weaver to an operator who had to step on a single treadle repeatedly. This article argues that algebra is already involved in operating shafts or heddles on ordinary looms, that this algebra was applied tacitly until the first weaving notations were developed, and that these notations make the tacit algebra of patterns recognizable to non-weavers: inventors and engineers. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","history of computing; history of weaving; Jacquard loom; pattern weaving",,2-s2.0-85019190842

I argue that women modelled a sculptural discourse that was distinctive, often personally driven and biographically inflected, and gendered. They deployed various forms of life writing–biography, autobiography, memoir, personal reminiscence, Bildungsroman, letters, gallery journals–as a vehicle for connoisseurship about sculpture. Cosmopolitan in outlook, they understood the importance of personal networks in both the production and the reception of art. Furthermore, female writers responded to the corporeal connections between viewers, models and figurative sculpture in their work. Writing about the three-dimensional representation of the human body in sculptural form enabled women to comment obliquely on issues such as female creativity, sexuality and education. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Anna Jameson (1794–1860); Art History; Criticism; Elizabeth Eastlake (1809–1893); Helen Zimmern (1846–1934); Life Writing; Nineteenth Century; Sculpture; Women",,2-s2.0-85019150095

Its nine articles provide further evidence for a known fact about the role of women in the art world of the time: the problem lies not in the historical lack of contributions, but in the historiographical silencing of women’s work and voices effected by the problematic gendering of modernity in the twentieth century. In fact, the lack of an academic discourse for art history in Britain until the 1930s entailed that connoisseurship was practiced mostly outside academia, which meant that women could develop their expertise in spite of having restricted access to universities. Our aim is not only to redress the gender imbalance in art historiography, but also to reassess the definition of connoisseurship as a “disseminated practice.” Rather than identifying connoisseurship with the act of attribution performed by one gifted individual, our authors put an emphasis on the culture of connoisseurship, intended as a web of expertise and professional networks. The flourishing of the art press and the empirical methods of scientific connoisseurship provided women with novel opportunities to earn critical authority in a disciplinary field that was still in the making. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Art Historiography; Collecting; Connoisseurship; Empiricism; Professionalism; Taste; Women",,2-s2.0-85020299667

It investigates the history behind the making of the first Uzbek national operas to be performed at the Bolshoi Theatre during the 1937 Dekada of Uzbek Arts and Music. The 1937 Uzbek dekada reconstructed and recontextualized Uzbek national music, while the dekada premiers of the Uzbek national operas Gulsara and Farhod va Shirin celebrated Soviet modernity and what Marina Frolova-Walker has termed “socialist cultural nationalism”. At the same time, they made obsolete indigenous attempts at modernizing local music which preceded Soviet modernization. This essay investigates the historical and cultural significance of the 1937 Uzbek dekada, and addresses how the dekada rewrote the Uzbek nation’s cultural historiography. It traces a local origin of “Uzbek opera” back to the early 1920s in order to uncover a local discourse on musical modernization and nationalization that was hidden behind the painted curtains of the Bolshoi stage. By connecting the 1920s and 1930s discourses on musical modernization and the making of an Uzbek opera, this essay ultimately engages with the imperialistic nature of Soviet modernization that overrode a local mode of modernity. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Central Asia; cultural imperialism; modernization; national culture; Soviet Union; Uzbekistan",,2-s2.0-85014522723

Although she begins her article by voicing a nervousness in venturing into and commenting on the world of social work, social work practitioners and academics will find much of value and resonance with what she writes as she considers how suffering can act as a spur to art. The space and distance necessary in order for a work of art to be arranged and contemplated might allow for the emergence of enhanced empathic understanding that could not be achieved without occupying this space. Trustram draws attention to the value of the museum as a place in which civilizations can show what they value and preserve what is left and, in doing so, she echoes Freud’s contention that archaeology has a special place in the history of psychoanalysis. She questions whether museums can help us to “see what we see” so that we can see beyond what restricts and is perceivable, through to that which could and might be. The experience of a powerful arrangement of exhibits in a museum can help the viewer feel ‘less alone’. This is a valuable and essential aspiration of effective social work practice and one which permeates several contributions throughout this special edition. By showing the pain of others the gallery simultaneously bears, preserves and ‘provides a bulwark against’ this pain. While illustrating the function and value of the museum gallery Trustram shows how a dream she dreamt has relevance to her work. There is also a thought-provoking discussion of exhibits that encourage the viewer to (literally) “take something away” as well as bring something to what is shown. The changing nature of the exhibit in the process of being viewed recalls the melting ice sculpture described by Malone in a previous article in this journal. Works of art including an older woman living alone in a tower block, a sapling held by a post, study for a sudden gust of wind, institutional bunk beds and travellers caught in a sudden breeze, are all discussed. The status of works not exhibited, “wrapped up within their own melancholy, waiting for some future”, are considered as is “the night time security” that is put in place to protect exhibits. Towards the end of the article Trustram writes, “The space and pace are here every day and can be used, or not”. Although written by someone not currently practising as a social worker, what the author conveys has much to offer to and inform social work thinking, practice and writing. We urge you to enjoy the space provided here at your own pace and to see what emerges from it. © 2017 GAPS.",,,2-s2.0-85027109561

I argue that it is better to understand the New Left in Britain as a practical political and cultural project, intervening in and productive of specific kinds of spatial environment. To develop this argument, two examples of such spaces are examined: The Partisan Coffee House, established in 1959 by Raphael Samuel as an ‘anti-expresso bar’ and the Secondary Modern school where Stuart Hall worked as a supply teacher.

The history of a modern army in Ethiopia is recent, beginning with the end of the Second World War. Since then, the Ethiopian army has gone through major changes under different regimes. However, it is only the latest version of the national army that has a properly organised military doctrine and strategy. Prior to this, the army’s concept of operations was shaped by the doctrines and strategies of its foreign sponsors. The organisation of the imperial army was influenced by the doctrine and strategy of Western armies (initially the British and later the Americans); the army’s concept of operations during the military regime was shaped by Soviet senior military advisors. The EPRDF army was an insurgent army that developed into a conventional army with its own set of military and military–political institutions, including its own military doctrine and its own concept of the science and art of war.

The author pursues this and other crossings between Fried's art historical writings and art criticism, tracking it to an extended endnote in Fried's Menzel's Realism: Art and Embodiment in Nineteenth-Century Berlin (2002). 'Art and Objecthood' is a key essay in this story aimed at Fried's thinking about criticism, its history, theory and practice.

What is sorely lacking is a historical account of how raciology fared in the late colonial and early postcolonial periods, roughly the period between the decline of craniometry and the rise of genomics. It is this history that I explore in this article. I argue that anthropometry, far from being a purely colonial science, was adopted by Indian nationalists quite early on. Various distinctive shades of biometric nationalism publicly competed from the 1920s onward. To counter any sense that biometric nationalism was teleologically inevitable, I contrast it with a radical alternative called ""craftology"" that emerged on the margins of formal academia amongst scholars practicing what I call ""vernacular anthropology.""

The difficulty they find in performing detail-oriented textual analysis is, in part, a product of their prior literature training which is significantly inflected by colonial history. Their resistance to the method, moreover, can be traced to issues of neoliberalism and globalization, most concretely in the mismatch they perceive between ""liberal learning"" and the job market awaiting them. For students to determine for themselves the value of close reading, I argue, they need to be trained to reflect on their modes of reading. My most sustained effort in this regard has been a seminar called ""Literature and Pedagogy,"" inspired by Gerald Graff's call for ""teaching the conflicts."" In focusing on the critical debates that have shaped the discipline of English, most students gain significant appreciation for the virtues of active and reflective learning while adopting a more critical stance vis-a-vis their prior literature learning and the university itself.

The artistic responses to traumas can be examined on the basis of the different types of trauma. This study reports on an investigation focusing on six types of trauma: emotional deprivation/neglect; near-death experience; becoming the victim of violence; war; accident/sickness and emotional frustration. Examples taken from the history of art indicate that works of art can draw attention to the traumatic experiences of the artists with frequently repeated motifs and portrayal techniques (sun, mother image, objects referring to the person lost, motifs of violence or symbols of violence, artistic manifestations of an exaggerated self-image, surreal visions, dry irony, substituting other objects for the beloved person), or a sudden change of style and subject that can express a heightened interest in human suffering (Lovis Corinth). An emphasis placed on self-portrayal can indicate the artist's increased self-examination, in cases of sickness, or continuous monitoring of the state of mind (Frida Kahlo, Otto Dix, Lovis Corinth, Edvard Munch). In some cases artistic activity can help to work through the trauma (Hans Bellmer, Oskar Kokoschka, Max Ernst, René Magritte), in other cases it is not able to prevent the development of psychological/psychiatric consequences of the trauma (Artemisia Gentileschi, Edvard Munch, Lajos Gulácsy). Traumas can be the sources of motivation and provide themes for works of art; and, although not in all cases, artistic creativity can contribute to effectively working through traumatic experiences.","Art; Emotional deprivation/neglect; Long-lasting grief; Perceived posttraumatic creative growth; Trauma","accident; art; Article; attention; creativity; emotional deprivation; frustration; grief; human; injury; motivation; self examination; traumatic experience; violence; war; arousal; emotion; mental stress; painting; posttraumatic stress disorder; psychology; quality of life; self concept; Arousal; Art; Creativity; Emotions; Humans; Paintings; Quality of Life; Self Concept; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Stress, Psychological",2-s2.0-85018692690

What is little-known, however, is the work of the designated scientist for psychiatric research, Hungarian Jewish émigré Francis Reitman, who was charged with an overall scientific analysis of the artistic products of the studio. Schooled in the biological psychiatric tradition of Ladislas J. Meduna in Budapest prior to his exile to the Maudsley Hospital in 1938 – and committed to treatments such as leucotomy and electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) – Reitman was an unusual candidate for research into the unconscious processes behind art and psychosis. Yet he authored two highly popular and widely reviewed books on his analyses of the abundant artistic output created by patients with schizophrenic diagnoses at the Netherne. In his Psychotic Art (1950) and Insanity, Art and Culture (1954), Reitman compared such schizophrenic images with those produced by artists under the influence of mescaline and examined the artistic output of patients having undergone leucotomy. This article draws on archival materials and Reitman’s original research publications in order to reconstruct his theory of schizophrenic art within the complex context of postwar British psychiatry, negotiating as he did between biologically reductive understandings of Freudian and Jungian psychoanalytic categories, and ultimately synthesizing concepts from both. It also analyses Reitman’s implicit theory of the therapeutic mechanism of art in the treatment of psychiatric patients. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","20th-century psychiatry; art therapy; biological psychiatry; body image; surrealism",,2-s2.0-85018772030

It is one of a few places in the world where a continuous history of people living with a changing environment for over 40,000 years is recorded through rock art. The art is under threat due to high concentrations of acidic and nitrate-rich pollution from nearby industrial complexes. Maintenance of the outer, rock or desert varnish, layer of the rocks is essential for preservation of the art. An increase in acidity of rock surfaces through acid rain and organic acids from nitrate-stimulated microbial growth may alter the mineral composition, integrity and colour of the rock varnish. This paper describes analyses of distilled water washings from rocks on Burrup Peninsula compared with rocks collected prior to industrialisation. Acidity of rock surfaces has increased from near neutral to a pH just above 4. The increasing acidity has been associated with a logarithmic increase in solubilisation of manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) compounds from the rock surfaces. A theoretical evaluation using electrochemical equilibrium principles confirms that increasing acidity will increase the solubilisation of Mn and Fe compounds. Removal of darker Mn and Fe mixed M(II)/M(III) compounds from the outer, rock varnish layer and the relative increase in ferrous oxide and illite/kaolin compounds will result in the rock surface layers becoming thinner, lighter, redder and more white/yellow over time. The impact on engraved surfaces would be expected to be greater because the rock varnish is thinner than on the non-engraved surface rock. Pollution from industry on Burrup Peninsula is likely to destroy the rock art over time. © 2017","Acid load; Colour change; Desert varnish; Industrial pollution; Petroglyphs; Pourbaix diagrams; Rock art; Rock varnish",,2-s2.0-85014119841

The history and method of the technical construction of these images is outlined. However, the paper focuses on introducing the scientific reader to visual literacy (e.g. human perception) and techniques from art (e.g. composition, color theory) since these techniques can produce not only striking but politically powerful public outreach images. When created by research astronomers, the cultures of science and visual art can be balanced and the image can illuminate scientific results sufficiently strongly that the images are also used in research publications.

Methods/Procedures First, a model of medical science situated within the history of medicine is described including (1) a limitation of the mathematical model of science, (2) the distinction between mechanistic science and mathematical science, (3) how this distinction is applied to medicine, and (4) how this distinction is applied to explain pharmacology to psychiatrists. Second, the neglected art of psychopharmacology is addressed by explaining (1) where the art of psychopharmacotherapy was hiding in the first author's psychopharmacology research, (2) how the Health Belief Model was applied to the art of medicine, (3) how the second author became interested in the Health Belief Model, and (4) his studies introducing the Health Belief Model in psychopharmacology. The authors' collaboration led to: (1) study of the effect of pharmacophobia on poor adherence and (2) reflection on the limits of the art of psychopharmacology. Findings/Results Low adherence was found in 45% (116/258) of psychiatric patients with pharmacophobia versus 22% (149/682) in those with no pharmacophobia, providing an odds ratio of 2.9 (95% confidence interval, 2.2-4.0) and an adjusted odds ratio of 2.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.8-3.5) after adjusting for other variables contributing to poor adherence.

Although the scientific research environment in South Korea at that time was insufficient, there was a scientist who achieved outcomes that could be recognized internationally while acting in South Korea. He was Ho Wang Lee(1928 ) who found Hantann Virus that causes epidemic hemorrhagic fever for the first time in the world. It became a clue to identify causative viruses of hemorrhagic diseases that were scattered here and there throughout the world. In addition, these outcomes put Ho Wang Lee on the global center of research into epidemic hemorrhagic fever. This paper examines how a Korean scientist who was in the periphery of virology could go into the central area of virology. Also this article shows the process through which the virus found by Ho Wang Lee was registered with the international academia and he proceeded with follow-up research based on this progress to reach the level at which he generalized epidemic hemorrhagic fever related studies throughout the world. While he was conducting the studies, experimental methods that he had never experienced encountered him as new difficulties. He tried to solve the new difficulties faced in his changed status through devices of cooperation and connection.

He was Fellow and assistant to Professor Flaviano Magrassi and studied nephrology at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, University of Harvard in Boston, under the guidance of John P. Merrill (1958-1960). He was nominated Professor of Nephrology at the University Federico II, Naples in 1975 and Professor of Medicine at the Second University of Naples (1986-2002). The National Institutes of Health of the United States in Bethesda financed his research for more than 20 years. He started low protein alimentation (Giordano-Giovannetti diet according to Geoffrey M. Berlyne) with or without addition of amino acids and ketoacids and devised formula diets for CKD infants and children. He demonstrated that 85% of CKD patients receiving a 25 g protein diet were in positive nitrogen balance. Later he introduced the concept of energy load from dialysate in CAPD and the assessment of amino acid losses during hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. He also researched the minimum protein requirement under CAPD regimens. He synthesized, with Professor Renato Esposito, oxystarch and oycellulose and introduced the use of carbon at low temperature and its regeneration at 90°C. He introduced wearable and portable artificial kidneys. He died in Naples on May 12, 2016.

To recognise a facial expression, a weighting strategy based on the latter feature and sub-division of the image frame is applied to the former to enhance the dynamic information of facial expression, and followed by the application of the classical support vector machine.

He lived from 73/74 BCE to 4 CE. He died with an illness and symptoms that have been the source of considerable speculation. Richard Strauss depicted Herod in his classic opera, “Salome.” That opera was derived from a play of the same name by Oscar Wilde, which was based on an 1876 painting, “Salome Dancing Before Herod,” by Gustave Moreau. The operatic Herod was afflicted with an illness characterized by dementia, hallucinations, paranoia, alcoholism (from drinking the Emperor’s wine), violence, twitches, and sterility; different interpretations showed him also with falls, chills, shaking, thirst, forgetfulness, and sleepiness, for which we suggest the novel diagnosis of chronic lead intoxication (which can manifest to rheumatologists as saturnine gout). He had compatible symptoms (encephalopathy and neuromuscular abnormalities) and consumed excessive quantities of imperial wine, known to be highly contaminated with lead and likely associated with similar symptoms among Roman aristocracy. Herod’s demented cruelties—an oppressive reign which including the beheading of John the Baptist—exacerbated the political climate and may have contributed to the subsequent violent 7-year revolt culminating in the destruction of the second temple.

Microwave ablation (MWA) produces large ablation zones (AZ) in short time; however, AZ prediction is based on preclinical ex vivo models, rising concerns about reproducibility and safety in humans. We aimed to investigate the effects produced by a new-generation MWA system on human liver in vivo with different approaches (percutaneous or intraoperative) and liver conditions (cirrhosis or previous chemotherapy treatment), in comparison with manufacturer-provided predictions based on ex vivo animal models. Complete tumor ablation (CA) and early clinical outcomes were also assessed. From October 2014, 60 consecutive patients (cirrhotic = 31; non-cirrhotic = 10; chemotherapy-treated = 19) with 81 liver nodules (HCC = 31; mets = 50) underwent MWA procedures (percutaneous = 30; laparotomic = 18; laparoscopic = 12), with a 2450 MHz/100 W generator with Thermosphere™ Technology (Emprint™, Medtronic). A contrast-enhanced CT or MR was performed after one month to assess CA and measure AZ. A linear correlation between AZ volumes and ablation times was observed in vivo, without differences from manufacturer-provided ex vivo predictions in all operative approaches and liver conditions. Other independent variables (sex, age, nodule location) showed no relationship when added to the model. Median (IQR) longitudinal and transverse roundness-indexes of the AZs were, respectively, 0.77(0.13) and 0.93(0.11). CA at 1 month was 93% for percutaneous and 100% for intraoperative procedures (p = 0.175). Thirty-day morbidity and mortality were 3% and 0%. MWA with Thermosphere™ Technology produces predictable AZs on human liver in vivo, according to manufacturer-provided ex vivo predictions.

Experimental crack growth behavior is compared to predictions based on two state-of-the-art analysis codes: UniGrow and FASTRAN. UniGrow is based on the idea that residual stress distributions surrounding the crack tip are responsible for causing load sequence effects in variable amplitude crack growth, while FASTRAN attributes these effects to varying degrees of plasticity induced closure in the crack wake. For variable amplitude fatigue tests performed under pure axial nominal loading conditions, both UniGrow and FASTRAN analyses were found to produce conservative growth life predictions despite good agreement with constant amplitude crack growth data. For variable amplitude torsion and combined axial-torsion crack growth analyses, however, the conservatism in growth life predictions was found to reduce. This is attributed to multiaxial nominal stress state effects, such as T-stress and mixed-mode crack growth, which are not accounted for in either UniGrow or FASTRAN, but were observed in constant amplitude crack growth tests to increase experimental crack growth rates. Additionally, by comparing experimental crack growth lives between tests performed using full and edited versions of the same loading history, it was found that a 94% reduction in loading history length resulted in differences in experimental crack growth life of less than a factor of 5. Since cracks in this study were initiated naturally, the effect of initial crack geometry assumptions on crack growth predictions was also investigated. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","FASTRAN; Fatigue crack growth; Multiaxial; UniGrow; Variable amplitude","Crack closure; Crack propagation; Crack tips; Fatigue crack propagation; Fatigue of materials; Fatigue testing; Forecasting; Torsional stress; FASTRAN; Fatigue crack growth behavior; Mixed-mode crack growth; Multiaxial; UniGrow; Variable amplitude crack growth; Variable amplitude fatigue; Variable amplitudes; Cracks",2-s2.0-85007470557

The research was carried out on a selection of rescued fragments. The data revealed the use of egg proteins as the paint binders of the original layers, in accordance with the traditional use of this proteinaceous medium in antiquity, spanning from the Mediterranean basin to the Far East, and already in the Bronze Age. Egg tempera was thus known to artists of the region in the first centuries AD, probably also due to the position of the Bāmiy.n valley, which was connected to the Silk Road. Milk was found in the first historical overpaintings. A new proteomics approach was used, which was able to identify the source of the milk proteins present in the restoration layers, despite their age and degradation. In particular cow's and goat's milk were both found, in agreement with the documented presence of rich pastures in the Bāmiy.n valley when the historical restorations were carried out. Investigating the materials of the Giant Buddhas not only enabled us to obtain isolated data on these invaluable works of art, which are now lost, but contributes to understanding the big apuzzleo of our past and the development of our culture, by implementing and supporting written sources, stylistic and anthropological studies with molecular data. © 2017 Lluveras-Tenorio et al.

The methods of micromorphology, scanning electron microscopy with an energy dispersive X-ray microanalyzer, X-ray fluorometry, and other techniques to determine the chemical and physical properties of the soils and sediments have been applied. Two paleosols have been identified in Tell Yunatsite with a total thickness of 9 m: the paleosol buried under the tell and the paleosol in its middle part. Sediments of Tell Körtik Tepe have a total thickness of up to 5 m; their accumulation began at the end of Pleistocene over the surface of buried paleosol. The cultural layer of the tells consists of construction debris mainly represented by a mixture of clay and sand and of domestic wastes with the high content of phosphorus. The major source of phosphorus is calcium phosphate (apatite) of bone tissues. The abundance of various anthropogenic materials in the sediments is clearly seen in thin sections. Even in the paleosols developed within the cultural layer (the mid-profile paleosol in Tell Yunatsite), the amount of microinclusions of bone fragments, charcoal, and burnt clay (ceramics) is very high. Micromorphological data indicate that up to 50% of the layered material filling an Epipaleolithic construction in Tell Körtik Tepe consists of the anthropogenic inclusions: bone fragments, charcoal, etc. The features of pedogenic transformation are present in the sediments. Such sediments can be classified as synlithogenic soils similar to the modern Urbic Technosols. It is shown that the formation of paleosols and sediments of Tell Körtik Tepe took place under extreme environmental conditions—arid climate of the latest Pleistocene climate cooling phase (the Younger Dryas, Tell Körtik Tepe)—and intensive anthropogenic loads (tells Körtik Tepe and Yunatsite). © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","buried soils; pedolithogenesis; soils of extreme anthropogenic sites; urban sediments; urban soils; urbanozems; Urbic Technosols","artifact; environmental conditions; extreme event; human activity; paleoclimate; paleosol; Pleistocene; sediment transport; soil property; urban area; Anatolia; Balkans; Turkey",2-s2.0-85018323673

Drawing on a database of over 2,600 working painters, the article explores the presence and role of the painters' occupation in rural England between 1500 and 1640. It emphasises the painters' accommodation to changing consumer demands; it offers a revised view of their geographic distribution over time; it shows that painters continued to serve the rural scene, albeit in somewhat different ways and from different locales than before.

Individuals following ARTs show behavioural variation, which might result in differences in energy intake and expenditure. However, few studies have compared activity budgets and non-sexual behaviour of individuals following ARTs in nature. We studied male African striped mice Rhabdomys pumilio, which can follow three ARTs: (1) breeding male of a group of females; (2) philopatrics remaining in their natal group; or (3) solitary living roamers. We predicted that each tactic is characterized by its specific activity budget, representing alternative energy trade-offs. We conducted focal animal observations on 70 males following ARTs. Roamers had higher travelling rates than philopatrics, and breeders had larger daily range sizes compared to philopatrics but not roamers. Philopatrics had higher foraging rates than breeders and showed more socio-positive behaviour than roamers. Breeders and philopatrics were in their nest more often than roamers, potentially engaging in social interactions with other group members. Roamers were chased off more often than breeders, but the three tactics did not differ concerning rates of socio-negative behaviour. Overall, philopatrics allocated their time towards behaviours that would increase body mass and survival probability, which could improve the probability to switch to a tactic of higher reproductive success. In contrast, breeders and roamers allocated their time towards behaviours that would increase their chances to mate. In conclusion, following ARTs results in contrasting activity budgets that reflect the differences in reproductive behaviours observed between tactics. © 2016 The Zoological Society of London","activity budgets; allocation; alternative reproductive tactics; biotelemetry; energy trade-off; movement ecology; Rhabdomys pumilio; social behaviour","activity pattern; alternative energy; biotelemetry; body mass; fitness; life history trait; movement; philopatry; reproductive behavior; reproductive success; resource allocation; rodent; sexual behavior; social behavior; survival; Animalia; Mus; Rhabdomys pumilio",2-s2.0-84999810210

Starting from the psychoanalytic field, the article explores the areas of art history and aesthetics, since art and creation (literary or other) are the receptacles of the unthinkable. Returning to the idea that the artist is in advance of the psychoanalyst, this article proposes to distinguish the function of aesthetic emotion and creation in the way the real is processed, in particular the emergence of writing for two subjects, one the analysand and the other the writer. Method This article sets three elements in perspective: (a) questioning derived from the author's analytical practice, where aesthetic emotion in the processing of the real has proved crucial; (b) theoretical considerations on the notions of trace and detail set in the area of psychoanalysis, aesthetics and art history; (c) consideration of a fragment of analysis derived from the author's clinical practice, and of the works of a writer. This method is in tune with the tripartite nature of psychoanalysis itself – treatment, research, conceptualisation – and it opens up towards other domains liable to cast light on the issues of the unconscious: aesthetics, art history, literature. Results This article shows the importance of the trace in the psychoanalytic process and the recognition of the unconscious. It evidences the conceptions of history and time that are specific to subjectivity, and restates that the psychoanalytic cure, far from seeking to fill the gaps in memory, focuses on a form of deconstruction aimed at the subject's fantasy. Following the path from remembrance to fantasy is not possible without working on the trace and the drive that it entails. The trace, like the symptom, calls up the real for the subject, and its interpretation relates to subjective truth. The analytic experience and the aesthetic experience are presented here for what they have in common–they find their orientation from the real. The exploration of the trace with the artist or the art historian shows the paradox of any processing of “a real”: sometimes approached as a sedimented narrative, sometimes as the blow of a truth, as a break. This shows that there is no possible processing of the real without accepting the unexpected and the unforeseen, and that in this journey aesthetic emotion can have a knotting function. Discussion This article proposes consideration of the trace underpinning the origins of psychoanalysis. The links between the trace, its registration, and subjective truth are examined. The function of fantasy in the reshaping of the trace and the real is also explored. The work by Carlo Ginzburg, Jacques Rancière and Daniel Arasse open up the exploration of the trace towards the domains of aesthetics and art history, and evidence the paradox that is specific to any processing of the real. The aesthetic dimension of the unconscious is broached and discussed on the basis of the trace and detail. The function of beauty in the relationship of the subject with the real and the emergence of creation is explored by way of the narrative of a subject and the work by Imre Kertesz. The article focuses on the idea that in the move from aesthetics to subjective truth there is an ethical challenge. Conclusion The article sets out a general conclusion returning to a conception of history and time that is specific to subjectivity. In the issue of the trace, there is a major challenge for the recognition of unconscious desire and humanness itself: the function of the trace is linked to the question of causality, and subjective response in the encounter with the real. Aesthetics and art history open up these considerations towards other areas of efficacy of the unconscious, and the question of aesthetic emotion can be seen in its specific knot function. © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS","Aesthetics; Desire; Drive; Psychoanalysis; Trace; Unconscious; Writing","case report; clinical practice; conception; ego development; esthetics; fantasy; human; narrative; psychoanalysis; psychological model; recognition; registration; symptom; theoretical model; writing",2-s2.0-84954271509

This essay argues that the Western political system broadly rests on the politics of liberal consensus, formed throughout the period of capitalist modernization. But Russia’s history took a different turn, following a path of alternative modernization. This engendered the politics of paradigmatic pluralism, in which a number of radically different politico-intellectual frameworks struggle for the dominant discourse.

Results: We identified 1067 HICs; 86 lost virological control, 293 initiated ART, and 13 died during virological control. Six years after confirmation of HIC status, the probability of losing virological control, initiating ART and dying were 13%, 37%, and 2%. Current lower CD4/CD8 ratio and a history of transient viral rebounds were associated with an increased risk of losing virological control. CD4 declined and CD8 increased before loss of virological control, and before viral rebounds. Discussion: Expansion of CD8 and decline of CD4 during HIV control may result from repeated low-level viremia. Our findings suggest that in addition to superinfection, other mechanisms, such as low grade viral replication, can lead to loss of virological control in HICs. © 2017 Chereau et al.

A thorough understanding of a tumour's subclonal composition and its mutational history is essential to open up the design of treatments tailored to individual patients. Comparative studies on a large number of tumours permit the identification of mutational patterns which may refine forecasts of cancer progression, response to treatment and metastatic potential. The composition of tumours is shaped by evolutionary processes. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing offer the possibility to analyse the evolutionary history and accompanying heterogeneity of tumours at an unprecedented resolution, by sequencing single cells. New computational challenges arise when moving from bulk to single-cell sequencing data, leading to the development of novel modelling frameworks. In this review, we present the state of the art methods for understanding the phylogeny encoded in bulk or single-cell sequencing data, and highlight future directions for developing more comprehensive and informative pictures of tumour evolution.

To think effectively in terms of relations of qualities is as severe a demand upon thought as to think in terms of symbols, verbal and mathematical. Indeed, since words are equally manipulated in mechanical ways, the production of a work of genuine art probably demands more intelligence than does most of the so-called thinking that goes on among those who pride themselves on being ""intellectuals"". It's impossible to know what Dewey would have thought had he lived beyond his ninety-two years and confronted the rock music and counterculture of the 1960s and early 1970s. Would he have found ""intelligence"" at work in ""acid rock"" or hippie culture? Or would he have reacted as rock critic Greil Marcus did in the famous opening line of his review of Bob Dylan's 1970 Self Portrait album: ""What is this shit?"" I'd like to think he'd have given the music a listen, if not at the Fillmore then perhaps on his home stereo. After all, Dewey had this to say about music: ""Music, having sound as its medium, thus necessarily expresses in a concentrated way the shocks and instabilities, the conflicts and resolutions, that are the dramatic changes enacted upon the more enduring background of nature and human life."" If any music expressed the shocks, instabilities, and conflicts of its day - and did so ""in a concentrated way"" - it was rock 'n' roll. In fact, sonic culture had a privileged place in Dewey's aesthetics as an expression of the emotional life of individuals and communities. ""Generically speaking, what is seen stirs emotion indirectly, through interpretation and allied idea. Sound agitates directly, as a commotion of the organism itself."" A philosopher who refused to sever sensory experience from cognition might well have considered whether somewhere in the commotion of rock culture there was also thinking. The question for historians committed to that proposition today is how and where to locate thinking in all the feedback. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2016.",,,2-s2.0-84958778327

The core assumptions derived from the implementation of socio-linguistic mechanisms transform the nature of legal analysis and are embedded within a diverse interplay of meanings. Aesthetic imaginings are evidenced to underpin and sustain ‘law’s symbolic processes and doctrines, institutions and ideas; that is, a realm of limitless fantasy, of free-flowing nomological desire, fixed around, and fixated upon controlling images that condense its central juridical concepts’; as the ‘jurists follow their own poetic and aesthetic criteria, their own spectral laws’ (MacNeil in Novel judgments: legal theory as fiction.

Yet still, founded on the negation of its own history, legal practice maintains that juridical arguments comprise only dialectical reasoning about objectively determined concepts: ‘law is a literature which denies its literary qualities. It is a play of words which asserts an absolute seriousness; it is a genre of rhetoric which represses its moments of invention or fiction… it is procedure based upon analogy, metaphor and repetition [that] lays claim to being a cold or disembodied prose’ (Goodrich in Law in the courts of love: literature and other minor jurisprudences.

Long County was selected as the study area. First, a landslide inventory map was constructed using history reports, interpretation of aerial photographs, and extensive field surveys. A total of 171 landslide locations were identified in the study area. Twelve landslide-related parameters were considered for landslide susceptibility mapping, including slope angle, slope aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, altitude, NDVI, land use, distance to faults, distance to roads, distance to rivers, lithology, and rainfall. The 171 landslides were randomly separated into two groups with a 70/30 ratio for training and validation purposes, and different ratios of non-landslides to landslides grid cells were used to obtain the highest classification accuracy. The linear support vector machine algorithm (LSVM) was used to evaluate the predictive capability of the 12 landslide conditioning factors. Second, LMT, RF, and CART models were constructed using training data. Finally, the applied models were validated and compared using receiver operating characteristics (ROC), and predictive accuracy (ACC) methods. Overall, all three models exhibit reasonably good performances; the RF model exhibits the highest predictive capability compared with the LMT and CART models. The RF model, with a success rate of 0.837 and a prediction rate of 0.781, is a promising technique for landslide susceptibility mapping.

The tradition has perhaps its most developed expression in the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. The strict formalism present in Eduard Hanslick's treatise, On the Musically Beautiful, clearly stands in stark opposition to such ways of thinking. And yet the book's final paragraph (in the first edition, at least) ends with a paragraph in which music is referred to as the 'sounding image of the great motions of the universe'. The present paper examines the extent to which this apparently Schopenhaurian moment in Hanslick can be reconciled with the formalism promoted by the rest of the book. I argue, in opposition to differing claims to the contrary made by Mark Evan Bonds, and by Christopher Landerer and Nick Zangwill, that the original concluding paragraph is inconsistent with the rest of Hanslick's argument. At the same time, the paragraph cannot simply be written off as a slip of the pen. Rather, it seems to reflect an anxiety on Hanslick's part about musical formalism failing to provide any account of why the art of music is valuable. © British Society of Aesthetics 2017.",,,2-s2.0-85029320874

This perspective is essential, yet it is important not to underestimate another little explored aspect: the epistemology of fiction, which relates at once to fiction as a form of knowledge and to the theory of fiction. Thus, the aim of this article is to identify different types of fiction and to determine how they took shape in different philosophical traditions, from Freud to Lacan. In this context, this text sets out to link the possible meanings of the word “fiction” in psychoanalytic thought and classic theories of fiction. This approach thus has a critical dimension, exploring various types of fiction – “aesthetic fictions”, “heuristic fictions”, “constructions”, “speculations” and “symbolic fictions”. Method This text is the result of critical research on fictions and theories of fiction, entailing the epistemological and historical analysis of Freudian and Lacanian positions. The theory of fiction is considered in its relationship with its models and the history of Western philosophy. Results This article shows how fictions have different meanings and modes of existence: aesthetic fictions, theoretical fictions, meta-psychological speculations and linguistic fictions are successively explored. Lacan opened up new ways of thinking about the symbolic dimension of fictions, offering a reappraisal of the Freudian position and a subversion of the symbolic order. Discussion Freud's definition of fiction in the “aesthetic” sense is a clear starting point. However, fiction cannot be reduced to the field of art and literature. There are different types of fiction: a concept in physics such as the atom, or a “fundamental concept” such as drive, can in certain conditions be considered as fictions. The concept of fiction is then discussed from a “theoretical” viewpoint. The specificity of “heuristic” fiction is linked back to the main precursors of Freudian fiction: Kant and Vaihinger. The complexity of the concept of fiction also results from the existence of different “models”, which evolved from Freud to Lacan. So while the Freudian model is “heuristic”, Lacan's approach explores another dimension, essentially linguistic. This epistemological shift is examined and discussed. Conclusion The epistemological status of fiction is not a timeless “given” nor an arrested structure, it is linked to heterogeneous conceptual fields and to the ambiguity of the concept itself. From an epistemological perspective, fiction is not a homogeneous concept. The detour via the philosophical tradition is essential to distinguish different “models” and define the logic of each type of fiction. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS","Epistemology; Fiction; J.

[Over het Nihilisme: Nietzsches actualiteit of de onze?]",2017,"Tydskrif vir Geesteswetenskappe",,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026391188&doi=10.17159%2f2224-7912%2f2017%2fv57n1a5&partnerID=40&md5=bb1d854155aeca2dc4f35cb1d8b976fd","If philosophy claims to be an analysis of the here and now, it should also reflect on the preconditions of a description and diagnosis of the present. One of the challenges presented by such an analysis is the risk of repeating the prejudices of the present in the description thereof. In this article, I attempt to address this challenge by presenting Nietzsche's description and interpretation of nihilism in such a way that the topicality of that description comes to light. Nietzsche distinguishes at least three different stages or forms of nihilism. The first one is also called pessimism, or more precisely: The pessimism of the tragic Greeks. It is an awareness of the absurdity of life and reality without becoming completely befuddled by it. The history of European culture from Socrates up to Nietzsche's 19th century is the period in which a second form of nihilism emerges. Unable to affirm the absurdity of reality, people started to devalue it and to interpret it in the light of a truer reality. This ultimate reality was conceived as meaningful and intelligible, and it showed the reality of our sensual experience to be unreal, only apparent and contingent. This schema is nihilistic because it denies the reality of our sensual world. It was introduced first and foremost by Plato's philosophy and then ""democratized"" in Christianity. But it dominated all of European culture (science, morality, religion and art) for 2500 years. The third stage or form of nihilism is associated with ""the death of God"", i.e. The erosion and eventual demise of the core concept upholding the protective structure that was built by the second phase of nihilism. The death of God is what Nietzsche foresees as coming to pass in the two centuries to come. His theory of nihilism is a description of this future. It proves not to be too difficult to present Nietzsche's description of this future in such a way that we recognize our present. There are at least three reasons why Nietzsche calls nihilism a European phenomenon. Firstly, Europe represents a great plurality of cultures and peoples. This situation could lead to greatness if it manages to maintain the tension and conflict among all the different tendencies. It is more probable, however, that the conflict and tension will be wiped out and that the collected plurality will lapse into a weak and ugly mixture or into indifference. Secondly, nihilism is already present in the two main roots of European culture: Greece and Christianity. In Greek mythology we learn that the world only emerged out of chaos by violent acts, and Christian theology interpreted the Jewish creation myth as a creation out of nothing. Chaos and nothingness are more fundamental than order and meaning. The third reason for calling nihilism a European phenomenon has to do with the strength and success of the second phase of nihilism: it has become so established that its very foundations may be questioned, without risking discrediting it as such. That is also the reason why the death of God is hardly understood, and the least of all by those ""who don't believe anymore"". All three reasons seem not to be limited to European culture, or the scope of European culture seems to be much broader than the borders of the European continent. If Nietzsche's predictions are indeed applicable to our present conditions, and if therefore we can gain some insight into ourselves by looking in the mirror of this 19th century European philosopher, it suggests that temporal and spatial distance is needed for self-critique. Here we are reminded of Nietzsche's saying that ""whoever wants to know how high the towers in a town are, [should] leave[.] the town."".","Analysis of the here and now; Europe; Nietzsche; Nihilism",,2-s2.0-85026391188

Currently, mold designs are mostly based on expert experience without a careful stress analysis and the mold tool life cycle relies largely on rough estimates. The industry state of the art applies averaged temperature change and peak pressure load on the mold tool. The static analysis is then performed. Mold temperature history and thermal shock are not considered in the durability analysis. In this paper, a transient thermal analysis of the tool is performed in conjunction with the injection molding process simulation. The spatial and temporal variation of temperature, pressure and clamping forces are exported from Moldflow simulation. These histories of temperature and pressure are converted to appropriate loading curves and mapped into Abaqus FEA model. A transient FEA simulation is performed in Abaqus for the length of the cycle time with temperature and pressure variation over the entire tool incorporated as loads. Thermo-mechanical stresses are predicted along with contact interactions. These stress histories are used for more accurate fatigue life prediction of the mold tool. This new methodology would help to avoid the risk of fatigue failure for injection molding tools. Costly tool rework and downtime would be avoided.

(Goya) The Great War was a contest no less of minds than of machines. This proved to be as true in the sciences as in literature and the arts. Across the scientific world blew a whirlwind of nationalism that threatened the traditions of science, revealing hidden tensions that cultural historians have yet fully to assess. Such was the impact of An die Kulturwelt! Ein Aufruf, or the Appeal to the World of Culture, better known today as the Manifesto of the Ninety-Three, which appeared in October 1914. In the history of modern science, few events are so widely recalled – and so often cited – as marking a tipping point beyond which Allied and American scientists saw no alternative to waging all-out war against the Central Powers. However, the scientific representation in the Manifesto has been largely neglected. This essay charts the background, reception, and consequences of the Manifesto for the wartime scientific community, and for the course of international science for decades to come. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group","Great War; legacies; Manifesto of the 93; nationalism; post-war; science; scientist intellectuals; war of words",,2-s2.0-85016499276

It plays a crucial role in practical applications, such as sequence learning. With a good memory mechanism, long term history can be fused with current information, and can thus improve RNNs learning. Developing a suitable memory mechanism is always desirable in the field of RNNs. This paper proposes a novel memory mechanism for RNNs. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) an auxiliary memory unit (AMU) is proposed, which results in a new special RNN model (AMU-RNN), separating the memory and output explicitly and 2) an efficient learning algorithm is developed by employing the technique of error flow truncation. The proposed AMU-RNN model, together with the developed learning algorithm, can learn and maintain stable memory over a long time range. This method overcomes both the learning conflict problem and gradient vanishing problem. Unlike the traditional method, which mixes the memory and output with a single neuron in a recurrent unit, the AMU provides an auxiliary memory neuron to maintain memory in particular. By separating the memory and output in a recurrent unit, the problem of learning conflicts can be eliminated easily. Moreover, by using the technique of error flow truncation, each auxiliary memory neuron ensures constant error flow during the learning process. The experiments demonstrate good performance of the proposed AMU-RNNs and the developed learning algorithm. The method exhibits quite efficient learning performance with stable convergence in the AMU-RNN learning and outperforms the state-of-the-art RNN models in sequence generation and sequence classification tasks.",,"Errors; Learning systems; Neural networks; Neurons; Recurrent neural networks; Software prototyping; Efficient learning; Memory mechanism; Recurrent neural network (RNNs); Sequence classification; Sequence generation; Sequence learning; Stable convergence; State of the art; Learning algorithms",2-s2.0-85016125010

The proposed framework, firstly extracts the human silhouette. Secondly, it takes out spatial and temporal cues from each frame. Then, it applies the MLP classification to the two set of features to obtain the Hidden CRF input; the final step is recognizing person with HCRF.

The differences between this and other methodologies for the self-assessment of trait- and state-like variation in the perceived characteristics of daily rhythms were discussed and the critical issues that remained to be addressed in future studies were highlighted. These issues include a) a failure to develop a unidimensional scale for scoring chronotypological differences, b) the inconclusive results of the long-lasting search for objective markers of chronotype, c) a disagreement on both number and content of scales required for multidimensional self-assessment of chronobiological differences, d) a lack of evidence for the reliability and/or external validity of most of the proposed scales and e) an insufficient development of conceptualizations, models and model-based quantitative simulations linking the differences between people in their sleep-wake pattern with the differences in the basic parameters of underlying chronoregulatory processes.

Yet the study of medieval art and visualities has, in general, remained Eurocentric in its canon and conservative in its approaches. 'Postcolonising', as the eleven essays in this volume show, entails active intervention into the field of medieval art history and visual studies through a theoretical reframing of research. This approach poses and elicits new research questions, and tests how concepts current in postcolonial studies - such as diaspora and migration, under-represented artistic cultures, accented art making, displacement, intercultural versus transcultural, hybridity, presence/absence - can help medievalists to reinvigorate the study of art and visuality. Postcolonial concepts are deployed in order to redraft the canon of medieval art, thereby seeking to build bridges between medievalist and modernist communities of scholars. Among the varied topics explored in the volume are the appropriation of Roman iconography by early medieval Scandinavian metalworkers, multilingualism and materiality in Anglo-Saxon culture, the circulation and display of Islamic secular ceramics on Pisan churches, cultural negotiation by Jewish minorities in Central Europe and the Iberian peninsula, Holy Land maps and medieval imaginative geography, and the uses of Thomas Becket in the colonial imaginary of the Plantagenet court. © 2017 selection and editorial matter, Eva Frojmovic and Catherine E.

Fuzzy linguistics is adopted to address the ill-defined nature of tourists' linguistic judgements so that they can be interpreted for the proposed MEC. By applying the ‘laddering' technique to interviews with 178 tourists, the resulting linkages strengthen the ability to probe outcomes and values and to derive a cognitive representation of nostalgic meanings. The findings of this research imply that, overall, tourists experience three different dominant perceptual orientations for nostalgic experiences in SCBA cultural festivals: ‘Learning and the challenge of a new experience', ‘Culture and art appreciation', and ‘The link between history and emotion'.

Besides, there exists natural noise in users’ ratings. In this paper, we propose a rating prediction algorithm named NF-SVM based on the analysis of users’ natural noise and relationships. We cluster users to sharpen the similarity attribute among users, and use an iterative algorithm to obtain the rank of users’ rating quality. Then, we analyze users’ rating history to obtain the attributes of users’ natural noise. All these attributes are used to build a training set for SVM to get a prediction model. We also tested our algorithm in a data set which is crawled down from Douban, one of the largest movie rating web sites in China. Then we compared our algorithm with other state-of-the-art rating prediction methods.

He also produced a large number of ingenious designs for warfare and a variety of highly original flying machines. But of particular interest to us are his contributions to bioengineering and how he used his knowledge of basic physical principles to throw light on physiological function. For example, he produced new insights into the mechanics of breathing including the action of the ribs and diaphragm. He was the first person to understand the different roles of the internal and external intercostal muscles. He had novel ideas about the airways including the mode of airflow in them. He also worked on the cardiovascular system and had a special interest in the pulmonary circulation. But, interestingly, he was not able to completely divorce his views from those of Galen, in that although he could not see pores in the interventricular septum of the heart, one of his drawings included them. Leonardo was a talented anatomist who made many striking drawings of the human body.

We compared a group of students of art history with students with no particular background in art, capturing their eye-movements while viewing Renaissance portraits. To balance central bias, 5 single and 5 double portraits were presented in an initial session limited to 10-s viewing time and in a second session with simultaneous thinking-aloud. Eye-tracking results show that in contrast to laypersons, art historians are more effective in searching for content that is promising for successful meaning-making when looking at representational art. Additionally, experts show deeper engagement with higher levels of meaning of this specific content and in general make more attempts at interpretation than laypersons. Considering the form versus content discussion in aesthetic psychology, this study provides first evidence that the predominate rationale that experts focus on style and laypersons on content is a rather rough perspective and can be refined by having a closer look at the perceptual and cognitive strategies of participants when looking at artworks of a specific style and genre.

Accordingly, the theory would predict that master painters should display biases toward visual properties such as symmetry, balance, and moderate complexity. Have these biases been occurring and if so, have painters been optimizing these properties (fluency variables)? Here, we address these questions with statistics of portrait paintings from the Early Renaissance period. To do this, we first developed different computational measures for each of the aforementioned fluency variables. Then, we measured their statistics in 153 portraits from 26 master painters, in 27 photographs of people in three controlled poses, and in 38 quickly snapped photographs of individual persons. A statistical comparison between Early Renaissance portraits and quickly snapped photographs revealed that painters showed a bias toward balance, symmetry, and moderate complexity. However, a comparison between portraits and controlled-pose photographs showed that painters did not optimize each of these properties. Instead, different painters presented biases toward different, narrow ranges of fluency variables. Further analysis suggested that the painters’ individuality stemmed in part from having to resolve the tension between complexity vs. symmetry and balance. We additionally found that constraints on the use of different painting materials by distinct painters modulated these fluency variables systematically. In conclusion, the Processing Fluency Theory of Esthetic Pleasure would need expansion if we were to apply it to the history of visual art since it cannot explain the lack of optimization of each fluency variables. To expand the theory, we propose the existence of a Neuroesthetic Space, which encompasses the possible values that each of the fluency variables can reach in any given art period. We discuss the neural mechanisms of this Space and propose that it has a distributed representation in the human brain. We further propose that different artists reside in different, small sub-regions of the Space. This Neuroesthetic-Space hypothesis raises the question of how painters and their paintings evolve across art periods. © 2017 Aleem, Correa-Herran and Grzywacz.","Balance; Complexity; Image statistics; Neuroaesthetic space; Neuroaesthetics; Portrait paintings; Processing fluency theory; Symmetry","brain; clinical article; controlled study; human; individuality; painter; painting; photography; pleasure; statistics; tension",2-s2.0-85015971768

The presence of these images in these particular places is a mark of their identity and of the heritage left by these ancient societies and their beliefs, ever since the first cultural manifestations of the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe. The specific choice of a wall or of a particular background, of a location in the cave can thus be just as significant as the image that one chooses to represent or the way in which they choose to represent it. This is why the present research intends to study the links between the images and their supports, through a family which has already shown a particular affinity with the space: the family of signs. The example of the signs highlights the fundamental role of the supports in the construction of images and the important and sometimes radical influence of the cave on their graphic identity.

In addition to the high propagation loss of the signals in these frequency ranges, the lack of activity of the current CMOS/SiGe devices (since the desired frequencies are close to their fmax or beyond it) emphasizes on the importance of coming up with new design methods in order to generate high output power signal sources. At UNIC group of Cornell university, we have a long history of designing mm-wave and terahertz signal generators. It started from designing oscillators close to the fmax with output power much higher than the state of the art oscillators in CMOS and SiGe technologies. It embarked on a 121 GHz fundamental oscillator with -3.5 dBm output power in a 130 nm CMOS process. To generate higher frequencies, harmonic generators and frequency multipliers have led to oscillators with oscillation frequencies beyond the fmax. For instance, a triple-push oscillator is fabricated in 65 nm CMOS process with -7.9 dBm output power at 480 GHz. In the next phase, to cope with the challenges of using varactors for frequency tuning, a novel injection-locked loop of oscillators is designed using these advanced oscillators as the core, which shows a 4.5% of tuning range at 290 GHz and has increased the output power to -2.1 dBm by combining the power of the fourth harmonic of four push-push oscillators. In another attempt, the injection-locked tuning loop is built upon eight voltage controlled oscillators (VCO's). Combining the output power of the second harmonic of the eight core VCO's leads to a maximum output power of 4.1 dBm at 256 GHz and the resulting VCO has a tuning range of 4.3% by employing two varactors, one inside the oscillator block and the other one in the phase shifter. At this point, the maximum DC-to-RF efficiency of all these oscillators were below 1.1% which compels the next challenging step to improve the DC-to-RF efficiency to a reasonable value. In this vital step, using a completely novel idea of shaping and maximizing the unilateral power gain of a two-port network (the measure of its activity), a fundamental oscillator is designed in a 130 nm SiGe process which has improved the DC-to-RF efficiency by a factor of 10 and has increased the output power to more than 4.8 dBm, utilizing only one transistor. This new approach enables the future THz and mm-wave systems to become both efficient and also capable of producing high output power. High tunability and frequencies higher than the fmax in addition to much higher output power can be attained by employing previous steps of combining the output powers and tuning through injection-locked loop of oscillators. © 2017 IEEE.","DC-to-RF efficiency; mm-Wave; Oscillator; Terahertz; VCO","Circuit oscillations; CMOS integrated circuits; Efficiency; Harmonic analysis; Integrated circuit design; Locks (fasteners); Millimeter waves; Monolithic integrated circuits; Oscillators (electronic); Oscillistors; Signal generators; Silicon; Silicon alloys; Terahertz spectroscopy; Tuning; Varactors; Variable frequency oscillators; Frequency multiplier; High data rate communications; Maximum output power; Millimeter-wave (mm-wave); Mm waves; Oscillation frequency; Push push oscillator; Tera Hertz; Terahertz waves",2-s2.0-85017295680

In this paper, we propose an architecture for personalized AUIs that leverages upon developments in (1) deep learning, particularly gated recurrent units, to efficiently learn user interaction patterns, (2) collaborative filtering techniques that enable sharing of data among users, and (3) fast approximate nearest-neighbor methods in Euclidean spaces for quick UI control and/or content recommendations. Specifically, interaction histories are embedded in a learned space along with users and interaction elements; this allows the AUI to query and recommend likely next actions based on similar usage patterns across the user base.

Although the home use of tDCS is often referred to as a novel phenomenon, in reality the late nineteenth and early twentieth century saw a proliferation of electrical stimulation devices for home use. In particular, the use of an object known as the medical battery bears a number of striking similarities to the modern-day use of tDCS. Objective This article reviews a number of features thought to be unique to the present day home use of brain stimulation, with a particular focus on analogies between tDCS and the medical battery. Methods Archival research was conducted at the Bakken Museum and at the American Medical Association's Historical Health Fraud Archives. Results Many of the features characterizing the contemporary home use tDCS—a do-it-yourself (DIY) movement, anti-medical establishment themes, conflicts between lay and professional usage—are a repetition of themes that occurred a century ago with regard to the medical battery. A number of features, however, seem to be unique to the present, such as the dominant discourse about risk and safety, the division between cranial and non-cranial stimulation, and utilization for cognitive enhancement purposes. Conclusion(s) Viewed in the long durée, the contemporary use of electrical stimulation at home is not a novel phenomenon, but rather the latest wave in a series of ongoing attempts by lay individuals to utilize electricity for therapeutic purposes. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Cranial stimulation; DIY tDCS; Electrical medicine; Electrotherapy; History of medicine; Medical battery; tDCS","cognition; device safety; electric battery; history of medicine; home care; human; patient risk; priority journal; Review; self care; transcranial direct current stimulation; United States; advertising; art; brain; devices; electrostimulation; history; physiology; transcranial direct current stimulation; Advertising as Topic; Brain; Electric Stimulation; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; Humans; Self Care; Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation",2-s2.0-85008168592

Slavery was a dehumanizing act that will always reside sadly in our personal history. The African slave trade played a large role in how society views African-American artists and their art today. Along with an early negative perception, we can see how the African diaspora positively affected American art today. At first, these early artisans were exposed to European art forms, and they adapted these art forms to their own artworks. However, experimentation would eventually lead these artisans, artists, and crafts people to infuse their art forms with a mixture of West African, European, and American cultural ideas. A number of seminal African-American artists will be examined, beginning with Robert S. Duncanson in Cincinnati in the mid-1850s to Henry Ossawa Tanner and Meta Vaux Warrick Fuller in the late nineteenth century. This artistic examination will then continue into the twentieth century and beyond. Thus, this overview will also include the artists during the pivotal Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s and 1930s, concluding with an examination of contemporary artists, such as Robert Colescott and Faith Ringgold. This article serves as a presentation of works, along with historical references, that cover the achievements of the leading African-American artists for more than 200 years in the American cultural art scene. © Common Ground Research Networks, Gay Sweely, Gwendolyn N.

The pathologies concerned are tentatively identified, and various rationales for their presence in the painting are discussed. Of particular importance is the location of the altarpiece in a chapel which houses the tomb of the Cardinal of Portugal, Prince James of Lusitania (1433–1459). It is argued that both the artistic style of the day and the religious symbolism of the Cardinal’s funeral chapel contributed to the artists’ decision to portray the saints with deformities. An unnatural curvature of the fifth finger was apparently considered elegant in fifteenth-century paintings, and the depiction of bare feet with hallux valgus gave them a shape which approximated and could have been caused by fashionable pointed shoes. But in addition, deformities in religious art could be symbolic of suffering and martyrdom, a theme which the Cardinal’s chapel emphasised in a number of ways. It is suggested therefore that the Pollaiuolo altarpiece reconciles these two disparate factors, portraying genuine deformities in a way that was artistically stylish and symbolically meaningful. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Camptodactyly; Clinodactyly; Disease in art; Hallux valgus; Osteoarthritis","art; Article; camptodactyly; Christian; clinodactyly; exostosis; foot malformation; hallux valgus; human; Italy; limb malformation; osteoarthritis; painting; priority journal; radial nerve palsy; spasticity; art; hand malformation; history; Hallux Valgus; Hand Deformities; History, 15th Century; Italy; Medicine in Art; Paintings; Saints",2-s2.0-84994761047

This paper describes an evaluation of an art therapy programme in an acute adult psychiatry admission unit in Ireland. A mixed method research design was used. Quantitative data were collected through a survey of 35 staff members and 11 service users. Qualitative data included free text comments collected in the survey and individual feedback from service users. Both methods aimed to assess the role of art therapy as part of a multidisciplinary mental health service. Thematic content analysis was employed to analyse qualitative data. Staff demonstrated overwhelming support for art therapy as one element within multidisciplinary services available to patients in the acute psychiatry setting, Qualitative feedback associated art therapy with improvements in quality of life and individual support, and emphasised its role as a non-verbal intervention, especially useful for those who find talking therapy difficult. Creative selfexpression is valued by staff and service users as part of the recovery process. Recommendations arising from the research include continuing the art therapy service, expanding it to include patients under rehabilitation, provision of information and education sessions to staff, and further research to identify other potential long-term effects. The low response of staff and small sample in this study, however, must be noted as limitations to these findings. © 2017, BMJ Publishing Group.

Of the many people who made history in those earliest days of surgical anaesthesia in both the United States and Great Britain, John Snow stands out for his personal research that spanned basic science and clinical medicine. Primarily, Snow used the relationship between the vapour pressure of a volatile liquid and temperature to design a vaporiser. This allowed control of the inspired concentration of the volatile liquid epitomised by diethyl ether, and thus the time-course and depth of anaesthesia. In an era when developments in anaesthesia were almost exclusively based on empirical modifications to apparatus and technique, Snow, and to a lesser extent his contemporary Andrew Buchanan, stood out from all others in advancing the quantitative basis of anaesthesia. Both described the physiological basis of control over gas uptake whereby they related that gas moved across concentration gradients in the body: alveolar to arterial to tissue to venous gas tensions, and Snow devised a progressional semi-quantitative scale of five 'stages' of ether anaesthesia. They thereby introduced the elements of what would be referred to 'pharmacokinetics' and 'pharmacodynamics', a century later. This essay attempts to place them and their scientific insights into context with contemporaneous principal personae and knowledge.","history, ether, vapour pressure, temperature, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, John Snow, Andrew Buchanan","ether; inhalation anesthetic agent; art; history; human; Anesthetics, Inhalation; Ether; History, 18th Century; History, 19th Century; Humans",2-s2.0-85029667823

Among these latter cases, there was a 35-year-old cattle-driver, John McCann, who was first admitted at hospital in 1840 because of a large tumour on the right side of his neck thought to be malignant (and a second tumour sublingually) but not operated. McCann was readmitted in 1843 (“in an emaciated state”), because of an immense tumour in his thigh dying few months later “with hepatic symptoms”. Smith’s post-mortem examination revealed dozens of smaller additional tumours. Based on application of modern diagnostic criteria (to McCann’s portrait at second referral) and on pathological grounds (reconsideration of the histopathological report of McCann’s neuroma of the thigh), we tentatively hypothesise that this patient could be the earliest (illustrated) example of either: (1) a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST); (2) neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2); or (3) schwannomatosis (SWNTS). The progressively enlarging masses, the emaciated state and the later death are in favour of a MPNST (against is the lack of malignant appearance at histopathology); the clinical (and gross pathological) appearance of the tumours as large, rounded, encapsulated, eccentric lesions deflecting the parent nerve over the surface of the tumour is typical of schwannomas (thus, in favour of NF2 or SWTNS). Whatever diagnosis we could consider these tumours could be secondary to a (local) mosaic loss of heterozygosity and ultimately represent type 2 segmental manifestations superimposed on an ordinary autosomal dominant trait (i.e., NF1, NF2 or SWTNS). © 2017, Springer-Verlag Italia.","Early history; Neuroma; Neuromata; NF1; NF2; Schwannomatosis; Smith","Article; autopsy; cancer diagnosis; cancer mortality; Colles fracture; congenital luxation; dislocation; human; Ireland; malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor; neurilemoma; neurofibromatosis; neurofibromatosis type 1; neurofibromatosis type 2; pathologist; plexiform schwannoma; rare disease; skin manifestation; surgeon; adult; art; case report; history; male; neurofibromatosis; neurology; neuroma; pathology; skin tumor; Adult; History, 19th Century; Humans; Ireland; Male; Neurilemmoma; Neurofibromatoses; Neurology; Neuroma; Pathology; Skin Neoplasms",2-s2.0-85009250890

This article explains his success as one of the most famous instrument makers who ever lived. Materials and Methods: A review of the literature was completed using PubMed. Additionally, material of historical sources like the museum of Bulle was used. Results: Joseph-Frédéric-Benoît Charrière was born in Switzerland in 1803. At the age of 13, he moved to Paris and learned the profession of a cutler. In 1820, he took over the workshop of his teacher Vincent. Dupuytren was one of the most important people in Charrière's professional life. Charrière specialized in the fabrication of surgical instruments of such high quality that he was very sought after by famous surgeons. In 1837, Charrière went to Sheffield, England, to learn more about working with metals and alloys. In 1851, he was inducted into the Legion of Honour. Charrière died in 1876 in Paris. Conclusions: The patronage of Dupuytren was a very important supporting factor in Charrière's professional life, but mainly his great courage, the willingness to learn from others, his creativity and technical fantasy and his curiosity and broad interest in a lot of different fields explain his unmatched professional success. © 2016 S.

Cendrars, whose right writing hand was amputated after a battlefield wound in 1915, described with acuity his stump pain and phantom limb syndrome. He became a left-handed writer. Between 1956 and his death in 1961, he also suffered two strokes that progressively paralyzed his left side and greatly diminished his ability to speak. Cendrars had started medical school in his youth and found that his ideas about the genesis of mental disorders conflicted with the generally accepted psychiatric conceptions of hysteria or psychoanalysis.

One of the main elements of this rapid social restructuring is the abandonment of naturalistic figurative art on portable pieces or on cave walls in the Magdalenian in favor of abstract expression on small pebbles. Recent work shows that the transformation of human societies between the Magdalenian and the Azilian was more gradual. The discovery of a new Early Azilian site with decorated stones in France supports this hypothesis. While major changes in stone tool technology between the Magdalenian and Azilian clearly mark important adaptive changes, the discovery of 45 engraved schist tablets from archaeological layers at Le Rocher de l'Impératrice attests to iconographic continuity together with special valorization of aurochs as shown by a ""shining"" bull depiction. This evidence suggests that some cultural features such as iconography may lag far behind technological changes. We also argue that eventual change in symbolic expression, which includes the later disappearance of figurative art, provides new insight into the probable restructuring of the societies. © 2017 Naudinot et al.

Research performed over the past few decades has provided improved insight into the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of this disorder. We aim to provide clinicians with an update regarding the state of the art in DCM, focusing on more recent research pertaining to pathophysiology, natural history, treatment, consideration of the minimally symptomatic patient, surgical outcome prediction, and outcome measurement. Current concepts of pathophysiology focus on the combination of static and dynamic elements leading to breakdown of the blood-spinal cord barrier at the site of compression resulting in local inflammation, cellular dysfunction, and apoptosis. With respect to treatment, although there is a dearth of high-quality studies comparing surgical to nonoperative treatment, several large prospective studies have recently associated surgical management with clinically and statistically significant improvement in functional, disability, and quality of life outcome at long-term follow-up. When selecting the specific surgical intervention for a patient with DCM, anterior (discectomy, corpectomy, hybrid discectomy/corpectomy), posterior (laminectomy and fusion, laminoplasty), and combined approaches may be considered as options depending on the specifics of the patient in question; evidence supporting each of these approaches is reviewed in detail. Recently developed clinical prediction models allow for accurate forecasting of postoperative outcomes, permitting enhanced communication and management of patient expectations in the preoperative setting. Finally, an overview of outcome measures recommended for use in the assessment of DCM patients is provided.

Because there are no unique clinical symptoms that point to a definitive diagnosis of AATD, laboratory testing is crucial to differentiate this disease from others. Objective: To summarize advances in laboratory techniques used to test for AATD. Methods: Data were sourced from a nonsystematic literature review of MEDLINE and the author's personal literature collection, and by checking reference lists of sourced articles. Results: Since the original description of AATD by Laurell and Eriksson in 1963, testing methods have undergone major changes. Currently, alpha-1 antitrypsin protein is quantified by immunologic measurement in serum, and the phenotype is characterized by isoelectric focusing and/or targeted genotyping of predefined mutations. In addition, whole-gene sequencing of the gene SERPINA1 can be undertaken. However, this is costly and generally used only if targeted genotyping cannot conclusively identify the variant. The introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS), which enables rapid and accurate sequencing of large quantities of DNA fragments in a single reaction, may help reduce costs. With its increasing availability, NGS may begin to appear in testing protocols. Clinical guidelines recommend that patients are tested for AATD if they have chronic irreversible airflow obstruction, especially those with early onset disease or a positive family history of AATD. Despite this, AATD is still underrecognized, and significant delays exist between symptom onset and diagnosis. Conclusion: Traditional testing practices have limitations. Screening programs that incorporate NGS are the most comprehensive methods available for accurate diagnosis of AATD.

It provides protection to primary users (PUs) from interference and creates opportunities of spectrum access for secondary users (SUs). It should be performed efficiently to reduce the number of false alarms and missed detections. Continuous sensing for a long time incurs cost in terms of increased energy consumption; thus, spectrum sensing ought to be energy efficient to ensure the prolonged existence of CR devices. This paper focuses on using of history to help achieve energy-efficient spectrum sensing in infrastructure-based CR networks. The scheme employs an iteratively developed history processing database that is used by CRs to make decisions about spectrum sensing, subsequently resulting in reduced spectrum scanning and improved energy efficiency. Two conventional spectrum sensing schemes, i.e., energy detection (ED) and cyclostationary feature detection (CFD), are enriched by history to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. System-level simulations are performed to investigate the sensitivity of the proposed history-based scheme by performing detailed energy consumption analysis for the aforementioned schemes. Results demonstrate that the employment of history ensued in improved energy efficiency due to reduced spectrum scanning. This paper also suggests which spectrum sensing scheme can be the best candidate in a particular scenario by looking into computational complexity before comparative analysis is presented with other states of the art. © 2016 IEEE.","Cognitive radio (CR); energy efficiency; history; spectrum sensing","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; History; Spectroscopy; Spectrum analysis; Cognitive radio network; Comparative analysis; Cyclostationary feature detection; Dynamic spectrum accesses (DSA); Energy consumption analysis; Number of false alarms; Spectrum sensing; System level simulation; Cognitive radio",2-s2.0-85015805575

We introduce a method for assessing the chronology of post-contact rock art sites from the northwestern region of the North American Great Plains through multivariate statistical comparison with dated examples of Blackfoot robe (biographic) art. Our analysis of four rock art sites indicates dates that are broadly consistent with previous dating assessments, but helps sharpen their chronology, which has important consequences for these sites with regard to their position in debates relating to the post-contact era history of the region. As is the case for any chronological technique (especially indirect), the method we describe is primarily a guide that should ideally be used in conjunction with other methods, although our analyses demonstrate it can be a valuable tool nonetheless. Although the applicability of the method is illustrated here using sites on the northwestern Plains, we are confident that it could be modified for use in other areas. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",,,2-s2.0-84999634737

It is the second leading cause of cancer death in Western Countries. In the last decade, the survival of patients with metastatic CRC has improved dramatically. Due to the advent of new drugs (irinotecan and oxaliplatin) and target therapies (i.e. bevacizumab, cetuximab, panitumab, aflibercept and regorafenib), the median overall survival has risen from about 12 mo in the mid nineties to 30 mo recently. Molecular studies have recently widened the opportunity for testing new possible markers, but actually, only few markers can be recommended for practical use in clinic. In the next future, the hope is to have a complete panel of clinical biomarkers to use in every setting of CRC disease, and at the same time: 1) to receive information about prognostic significance by their expression and 2) to be oriented in the choice of the adequate treatment. Moreover, molecular analyses have shown that the natural history of all CRCs is not the same. Individual patients with same stage tumors may have different long-term prognosis and response to therapy. In addition, some prognostic variables are likely to be more important than others.

More recently, jellyfish fisheries have expanded to the Western Hemisphere, often driven by demand from Asian buyers and collapses of more traditional local fish stocks. Jellyfish fisheries have been attempted in numerous countries in North, Central, and South America, with varying degrees of success. Here, we chronicle the arrival of jellyfish fisheries in the Americas and summarize relevant information on jellyfish fishing, processing, and management. Processing technology for edible jellyfish has not advanced, and presents major concerns for environmental and human health. The development of alternative processing technologies would help to eliminate these concerns and may open up new opportunities for markets and species. We also examine the biodiversity of jellyfish species that are targeted for fisheries in the Americas. Establishment of new jellyfish fisheries appears possible, but requires a specific combination of factors including high abundances of particular species, processing knowledge dictated by the target market, and either inexpensive labor or industrialized processing facilities. More often than not, these factors are not altogether evaluated prior to attempting a new jellyfish fishery. As such, jellyfish fisheries are currently expanding much more rapidly than research on the subject, thereby putting ecosystems and stakeholders’ livelihoods at risk. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Gelatinous zooplankton; Jellies; Jellyfish fishery; Scyphomedusae; Scyphozoa; Zooplankton fisheries","abundance; biodiversity; fishery; fishing; jellyfish; zooplankton; Central America; North America; South America; Scyphomedusae; Scyphozoa",2-s2.0-84988429381

However, with the growing number of reusable software libraries in code repositories, finding and adopting a relevant software library becomes a fastidious and complex task for developers. Objective: In this paper, we propose a novel approach called LibFinder to prevent missed reuse opportunities during software maintenance and evolution. The goal is to provide a decision support for developers to easily find “useful” third-party libraries to the implementation of their software systems. Method: To this end, we used the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), a multi-objective search-based algorithm, to find a trade-off between three objectives: 1) maximizing co-usage between a candidate library and the actual libraries used by a given system, 2) maximizing the semantic similarity between a candidate library and the source code of the system, and 3) minimizing the number of recommended libraries. Results: We evaluated our approach on 6083 different libraries from Maven Central super repository that were used by 32,760 client systems obtained from Github super repository. Our results show that our approach outperforms three other existing search techniques and a state-of-the art approach, not based on heuristic search, and succeeds in recommending useful libraries at an accuracy score of 92%, precision of 51% and recall of 68%, while finding the best trade-off between the three considered objectives. Furthermore, we evaluate the usefulness of our approach in practice through an empirical study on two industrial Java systems with developers. Results show that the top 10 recommended libraries was rated by the original developers with an average of 3.25 out of 5. Conclusion: This study suggests that (1) library usage history collected from different client systems and (2) library semantics/content embodied in library identifiers should be balanced together for an efficient library recommendation technique. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Multi-objective optimization; Search-based software engineering; Software library; Software reuse","Computer software selection and evaluation; Decision support systems; Economic and social effects; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Reusability; Semantics; Software engineering; Minimizing the number of; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA II); Recommendation techniques; Search-based algorithms; Search-based software engineering; Software libraries; Software maintenance and evolution; State-of-the-art approach; Computer software reusability",2-s2.0-85006282719

We explored changing iNTS incidence associated with increasing ART availability in South Africa. Methods Laboratory-based surveillance for iNTS was conducted in Gauteng Province, South Africa, with verification using the National Health Laboratory Service's Central Data Warehouse (CDW), between 2003 and 2013. Isolates were serotyped at the Centre for Enteric Diseases. CDW data on patient numbers obtaining HIV viral load measurements provided estimates of numbers of HIV-infected patients receiving ART. A Poisson regression model was used to measure the changing incidence of iNTS infection from 2003 to 2013. The correlation between the incidence of iNTS and ART use from 2004 to 2013 was determined using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Results From 2003-2013, the incidence of iNTS per 100,000 population per year decreased from 5.0 to 2.2 (p < .001). From 2004 to 2013, the incidence per 100,000 population of HIV viral load testing increased from 75.2 to 3,620.3 (p < .001). The most common serotypes causing invasive disease were Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella Typhimurium), and Salmonella Enteritidis: 2,469 (55.4%) and 1,156 (25.9%) of 4,459 isolates serotyped, respectively. A strong negative correlation was observed between decreasing iNTS incidence and increasing ART use from 2004 to 2013 (r = -0.94, p < .001). Similarly, decreasing incidence of invasive Salmonella Typhimurium infection correlated with increasing ART use (r = -0.93, p < .001). Incidence of invasive Salmonella Enteritidis infection increased, however (r = 0.95, p < .001). Between 2003 and 2004, fewer adult men than women presented with iNTS (maleto- female rate ratio 0.73 and 0.89, respectively). This was reversed from 2005 through 2013 (ranging from 1.07 in 2005 to 1.44 in 2013). Adult men accessed ART less (male-to-female rate ratio ranging from 0.61 [2004] to 0.67 [2013]). Conclusions The incidence of iNTS infections including Salmonella Typhimurium decreased significantly in Gauteng Province in association with increased ART utilization. Adult men accessed ART programs less than women, translating into increasing iNTS incidence in this group. Monitoring iNTS incidence may assist in monitoring the ART program. Increasing incidence of invasive Salmonella Enteritidis infections needs further elucidation.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",,"antiretrovirus agent; antiretrovirus agent; adolescent; adult; age distribution; aged; antiretroviral therapy; child; controlled study; correlational study; disease association; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; incidence; infant; major clinical study; male; middle aged; newborn; nonhuman; Review; risk assessment; risk reduction; Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis; Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium; salmonellosis; serotyping; sex difference; South Africa; viral load testing; classification; drug effects; health survey; highly active antiretroviral therapy; history; HIV Infections; incidence; mixed infection; preschool child; Salmonella enterica; Salmonella Infections; very elderly; virology; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Retroviral Agents; Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active; Child; Child, Preschool; Coinfection; Female; History, 21st Century; HIV Infections; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Population Surveillance; Salmonella enterica; Salmonella Infections; Salmonella typhimurium; South Africa; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85014730078

SUMMARY ANSWER: One in three women had been pregnant at some stage in their lives and while most still wanted to have a child or another child, very few had used their stored oocytes, predominantly because they did not want to be single parents. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The number of healthy women who freeze oocytes to avoid age-related infertility is increasing. Evidence about reproductive outcomes after oocyte cryopreservation for non-medical reasons is needed to help women make informed decisions. STUDY DESIGN SIZE, DURATION: A cross-sectional survey was carried out. Study packs which included a self-administered questionnaire were mailed by clinic staff to 193 eligible women. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Women who had stored oocytes for non-medical reasons at Melbourne IVF, a private ART clinic, between 1999 and 2014 were identified from medical records and invited to complete an anonymous questionnaire about their reproductive histories and experience of oocyte cryopreservation. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of 10 survey packs were returned to the clinic marked 'address unknown'. Of the 183 potential respondents, 96 (53%) returned the questionnaire. One respondent provided only free-text comments, thus data from 95 respondents were compiled. The mean age at the time of freezing oocytes was 37.1 years (SD ± 2.6, range: 27-42) and the average number of oocytes stored was 14.2 (SD ± 7.9, range: 0-42); 2% had attempted to store oocytes but had none suitable for freezing, 24% had stored <8 oocytes, 35% had 8-15, 25% had 16-23 and 14% had stored >23 oocytes. About one-third of respondents (34%) had been pregnant at some point in their lives. Six women (6%) had used their stored oocytes and three of them had given birth as a result. The main reason for not using stored oocytes was not wanting to be a single parent. Of the 87 (91%) women who still had oocytes stored, 21% intended to use them while 69% indicated that their circumstances would determine usage. The mean number of children respondents would ideally have liked to have was significantly higher than the number of children they expected to have (2.11 versus 1.38, P < 0.001). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The limitations are inherent to any anonymously completed questionnaire: participation bias, missing data and the possibility that some questions or response alternatives may have been ambiguous. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The findings add to the very limited evidence about the reproductive outcomes experienced by women who freeze oocytes for non-medical reasons and can be used to help women make informed decisions about whether to store oocytes. © The Author 2017.

Yet such evidence increases from the Lower to Middle Palaeolithic, with the appearance of the first incontestable burials and symbolic representations, in the form of collected shells and colorants. With the Upper Palaeolithic, the archaeological record is more abundant. It is then possible to address spiritual aspects, the component of non-technological human behaviour beyond subsistence, lithic reduction or hafting techniques. Figurative art appears, in both mobile and parietal form, the iconography and organisation of which are structured. Painted caves seem to have been places for ritual practices in addition to having been selected for art alone. Evidence of visits and archaeological deposits reflect a space for possible exchanges between the human and spirit worlds in the framework of an animist world view. In the religious domain, such data allow the reconstruction of some elements of mythical thought, analogous to that described by ethnologists and historians of religions in other contexts.

Existing detectors only operate in a scenario that the image under investigation is explicitly available in JPEG format. Consequently, if quantization information of JPEG files is unknown, their performance dramatically degrades. Our method addresses both forensic scenarios which results in a fresh perceptual detection pipeline. We suggest a dimensionality reduction algorithm to visualize behaviors of a big database including various single and double compressed images. Based on intuitions of visualization, three bottom-up, top-down and combined top-down/bottom-up learning strategies are proposed. Our tool discriminates single compressed images from double counterparts, estimates the first quantization in double compression, and localizes tampered regions in a forgery examination. Extensive experiments on three databases demonstrate results are robust among different quality levels. F1-measure improvement to the best state-of-the-art approach reaches up to 26.32 %.

So far, it has been associated with mutations only in the Aurora Kinase C gene (AURKC) in some cases. Although many publications have reported failure to conceive in couples with macrozoospermia, a few others have described successful pregnancies, thus raising questions as to whether ICSI and AURKC genetic screening should be recommended in all patients with macrozoospermia. First, we report on two monozygotic twins presenting macrozoospermia for whom the genetic status was explored (Aurora Kinase C sequencing) and whole semen and gradient-selected spermatozoa were analyzed, using Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH), Electron Microscopy and flow cytometry. Additionally, FISH analysis was performed on individually selected uniflagellate spermatozoa with normal sized heads. Second, we also provide an updated review of patients with macrozoospermia gathering the percentage of enlarged head spermatozoa, the genetic status and pregnancy outcomes. Both twins carried a homozygous mutation of AURKC. Spermocytograms showed means of 86% and 83.5% of enlarged head forms. FISH analyses showed that normal head size, uniflagellate spermatozoa had an aneuploid or polyploid nucleus despite a high level of selection. SEM analysis also showed special intranuclear inclusions in enlarged head spermatozoa. Our data together with cases reported in the literature allowed us to recommend that the AURKC gene should be sequenced when the sperm contains 30% or more of enlarged head spermatozoa, and when a mutation is found, ART should not be performed. Our analyses provide information that could greatly help practitioners in their decision-making with regard to optimal care of patients with macrozoospermia. © 2017 American Society of Andrology and European Academy of Andrology.","Assisted reproductive technologies; Aurora kinase C gene; Macrozoospermia; Pregnancy outcomes","aurora C kinase; adult; aneuploidy; Article; case report; cell nucleus inclusion body; cephalometry; controlled study; diagnostic test; DNA sequence; electron microscopy; flow cytometry; fluorescence in situ hybridization; gene mutation; genetic analysis; genetic screening; human; infertility therapy; macrozoospermia; male; male infertility; medical history; monozygotic twins; polyploidy; pregnancy outcome; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy; semen analysis; spermatozoon abnormality; spermatozoon count; spermatozoon motility",2-s2.0-85011971669

It presents and consolidates a growing corpus of art historical feminist scholarship on the domestic in relation to modernist, postmodernist, and contemporary practice. The ten original research articles focus on the work of Louise Nevelson, Ida Applebroog, Carolee Schneemann, Carla Accardi, Lea Lublin, Ella Bergmann-Michel, Paulette Bernège, Sister Seven, Maxine Walker, and women as photographers in the context of post-Web 2.0 user-led digital technology. Contributors share a common interest in the artistic and scholarly problems that arise when the feminist politics of artistic agency are positioned in critical and productive relation to the feminist politics of domesticity. Scholars tackle themes that include labour, temporality, and domestic methodology; housing structures imagined for living differently; collective and individual resistance and radical domesticity; and fantastical entanglements of sexuality in domesticity, together with the various economies - formal, visual, political, psychic, that attach to each. In sum, Feminist Domesticities poses the crucial question of how we might encounter the value of domesticity as concept, environment, and object for art that is and has been made from and in response to feminism whilst resisting domesticity's oppressive pre-eminence in the definition of femininity. © The Author 2017.",,,2-s2.0-85020313813

To fill the gap, this article presents a study based on data collected from ResearchGate. Adopting a mixed-method design by conducting qualitative content analysis and statistical analysis on 1,128 posts collected from ResearchGate Q&A, we examine how scholars exchange information and resources, and how their practices vary across three distinct disciplines: library and information services, history of art, and astrophysics. Our results show that the effect of a questioner's intention (i.e., seeking information or discussion) is greater than disciplinary factors in some circumstances. Across the three disciplines, responses to questions provide various resources, including experts' contact details, citations, links to Wikipedia, images, and so on. We further discuss several implications of the understanding of scholarly information exchange and the design of better academic social networking interfaces, which should stimulate scholarly interactions by minimizing confusion, improving the clarity of questions, and promoting scholarly content management. © 2016 ASIS&T",,"Astrophysics; Information dissemination; Information services; Websites; Academic social networkings; Content analysis; Content management; Design goal; Information exchanges; Mixed method; Multi disciplines; On-line interactions; Social networking (online); content analysis; human; information service; social network; statistical analysis",2-s2.0-84980417153

Although treatment of people living with HIV (PLHIV) with antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces TB-associated morbidity and mortality, incident TB can occur while on ART. We estimated incidence and characterized factors associated with TB after ART initiation in Nigeria. Methods: We analyzed retrospective cohort data from a nationally representative sample of adult patients on ART. Data were abstracted from 3,496 patient records, and analyses were weighted and controlled for a complex survey design. We performed domain analyses on patients without documented TB disease and used a Cox proportional hazard model to assess factors associated with TB incidence after ART. Results: At ART initiation, 3,350 patients (95.8%) were not receiving TB treatment. TB incidence after ART initiation was 0.57 per 100 person-years, and significantly higher for patients with CD4<50/μL (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR]: 4.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4-12.7) compared with CD4≥200/μL. Patients with suspected but untreated TB at ART initiation and those with a history of prior TB were more likely to develop incident TB (AHR: 12.2, 95% CI: 4.5-33.5 and AHR: 17.6, 95% CI: 3.5-87.9, respectively). Conclusion: Incidence of TB among PLHIV after ART initiation was low, and predicted by advanced HIV, prior TB, and suspected but untreated TB. Study results suggest a need for improved TB screening and diagnosis, particularly among high-risk PLHIV initiating ART, and reinforce the benefit of early ART and other TB prevention efforts. © 2017 This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

In the UK MTCT rate has fallen from 25.6% in the 1990s to 0.46%. We review the management of HIV in pregnancy in Brighton in the context of evolving guidelines. Study design HIV, obstetric and neonatal notes of all HIV positive women, pregnant between 2003 and 2014, were reviewed. Results 97 pregnancies in 75 women were identified, resulting in 79 live births. Antenatal HIV diagnosis was made in 22 (28%). The proportion of pregnancies in those with known HIV at conception increased over the time period. At conception 58 (60%) were on ART, 33 (57%) of who continued on their original regimen. 34 (35%) initiated ART following conception: 14 known to be HIV positive, 20 diagnosed during pregnancy. Two did not start ART (1 due to miscarriage, 1 as diagnosed post-delivery) and in three cases ART history was unavailable due to transfer to alternative centres. ART was initiated on average at 22 weeks gestation (range 6–34). 4(5%) received Zidovudine (AZT) monotherapy, all before 2006. Choice of combination ART (cART) varied with time reflecting changing guidelines. Prior to 2008 an AZT containing regimen was used in 83% versus 8% after. Planned mode of delivery was documented in 73: 30(41%) planned a normal vaginal delivery (NVD), 43(59%) a caesarean section (CS). The viral load (VL) was <50 copies/mL in 58(76%) at 36 weeks and 64(84%) at delivery. 90% with a detectable VL at 36 weeks delivered via CS. 100% received neonatal post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP): 68(88%) AZT monotherapy, 9(12%) cART. 84% initiated PEP within four hours. 90% completed 28 days. 8(10%) babies experienced side effects. In the 10-year review period, one infant (1.3%) was diagnosed HIV positive. Both mother and infant received care in accordance with guidelines, including neonatal PEP within 4 hours. Conclusion Care of the HIV positive pregnant woman in Brighton has been successful with overall transmission consistent with that seen nationally.

This is especially true of the dental treatment of (mostly elder) persons with dementia, calling for an in-depth assessment of the various normative implications. Arguments: In geriatric dentistry in particular, situational dilemmas regarding treatment often arise from specific constellations (e. g. greatly reduced potential for dental therapy, lack of ability regarding oral hygiene and lack of individual patient responsibility) combined with an acute need for treatment and the necessary involvement of third parties. These dilemmas frequently place additional professional and normative demands on the dentist. The current contribution discusses this specific situation, first by way of theoretical discourse and subsequently with a case-related approach on the basis of two case histories. Conclusion: It becomes clear here that classic state-of-the-art therapies are replaced by “compromise treatment” in many cases in geriatric dentistry. Such treatment follows divergent diagnostic and therapeutic rules, poses changed requirements in terms of communication and presents specific ethical challenges and pitfalls. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Dementia; Dental functional capability; Elderly persons; Gerodontology; Principlism",,2-s2.0-85007198101

Methods and analysis This prospective study will be undertaken in about 400 infants to investigate the direct and indirect effects of filaggrin (FLG) gene mutations, the genetic variants of FADS1, FADS2 and FADS3 and the role of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) on the development of AD. We will use standardised protocols for subject recruitment, umbilical artery plasma analysis, buccal cell sampling for genotyping, fatty acid analysis, physical exams, 3-day food-intake recall of mothers and children, as well as comprehensive questionnaires on environmental, socioeconomic and AD-related factors, including family history. Monthly monitoring by telephone and physical exams every 3â €..months will be carried out to assess participants' anthropometry, medical history and incidence of AD diagnosis during the first year of life. Hypotheses-driven analyses of quality-controlled dietary, genetic and metabolic data will be performed with state-of-The-Art statistical methods (eg, AD-event history, haplotype, dietary or metabolic factor analysis). Direct and indirect effects of genetics and LCPUFA in buccal cell and cord plasma glycerophospholipids as potential mediators of inflammation on AD development will be evaluated by path analysis.

In so doing, my article argues that Nuttall's contributions to global counterculture challenge the critical consensus that British avant-garde writers were merely imitators of their US counterparts. By exploring the impact of Nuttall's My Own Mag (1963-67) and Bomb Culture (1968), it can be shown that Nuttall was a central catalyst of, and contributor to, the International Underground. As a poet, novelist and artist, Nuttall's multidisciplinary contributions to art were at the forefront of avant-garde practices that sought to challenge the perceived limitations of the novel as a social realist document and visual art as a medium confined to canvas.","International Poetry Incarnation; Jeff Nuttall; My Own Mag; Underground counterculture",,2-s2.0-85017965254

Around the same time, however, the portrait gallery emerged as a significant literary motif and began to proliferate in Gothic fiction, satirical tales, fin de siècle novels, and other fiction. This migration of the gallery into the realm of literature represents an important revaluation of the cultural capital associated with this art form and calls attention to the troubled cultural protocols and visualities of an age which saw the rise of a rival institution, viz., the public museum.

Huysmans, Oscar Wilde, Marcel Schwob, and R. M. Rilke to modern adaptations by James Joyce, Hermann Hesse, Salman Rushdie, Giovanni de Lampedusa, and others. As such, it offers a genealogy of literary portrait galleries and contributes to an emerging field, viz., the literary history of material culture.","Cultural capital; European fiction; Material culture; Museums; Portrait galleries; Sites of memory; Thematology",,2-s2.0-85018612345

In this study, an approach that uses state-of-the-art features designed for speech and speaker state recognition is presented. A method for voice activity detection was employed previous to feature extraction. Our analysis includes several classification techniques (multilayer perceptrons, support vector machines and random forest) and compares their performance using different configurations to define the best classification method. The experimental results were validated in a cross-validation scheme, using 25 species of the family Furnariidae that inhabit the Paranaense Littoral region of Argentina (South America).

Revisiting the colorful careers of its inhabitants reveals the complex economy in which they worked, the power of great corporations and licensing bodies, and the indefatigable spirit required to persist in the music industry for decades. This is the story of two of these inhabitants, Barney Young and Gloria Parker. Barney was a music publisher, composer, personal manager, lawyer, and song plugger. Gloria, who was his co-composer, star performer, and fiancée, was a versatile bandleader, contralto, marimbist, and, most exceptionally, musical glasses virtuoso.

Agent-based modelling is a valuable tool to achieve this because it can represent the behaviour and interactions of organisms, human actors and institutions. Agent-based models (ABMs) have therefore already been widely used to study SES. However, ABMs of SES are by their very nature complex. They are therefore difficult to parameterize and analyse, which can limit their usefulness. It is time to critically reflect upon the current state-of-the-art to evaluate to what degree the potential of agent-based modelling for gaining general insights and supporting specific decision-making has already been utilized. We reviewed achievements and challenges by building upon developments in good modelling practice in the field of ecological modelling with its longer history. As a reference, we used the TRACE framework, which encompasses elements of model development, testing and analysis. We firstly reviewed achievements and challenges with regard to the elements of the TRACE framework addressed in reviews and method papers of social-ecological ABMs. Secondly, in a mini-review, we evaluated whether and to what degree the elements of the TRACE framework were addressed in publications on specific ABMs. We identified substantial gaps with regard to (1) communicating whether the models represented real systems well enough for their intended purpose and (2) analysing the models in a systematic and transparent way so that model output is not only observed but also understood. To fill these gaps, a joint effort of the modelling community is needed to foster the advancement and use of strategies such as participatory approaches, standard protocols for communication, sharing of source code, and tools and strategies for model design and analysis. Throughout our analyses,we provide specific recommendations and references for improving the state-of-the-art. We thereby hope to contribute to the establishment of a new advanced culture of agent-based modelling of SES that will allowus to better develop general theory and practical solutions. © 2017, University of Surrey.

To better understand factors associated with high VL, we examined characteristics of patients presenting for treatment in Hanoi, Vietnam. We examined baseline data from the Viral Load Monitoring in Vietnam Study, a randomized controlled trial of routine VL monitoring in a population starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) at a clinic in Hanoi. Patients with prior treatment failure or ART resistance were excluded. Characteristics examined included demographics, clinical and laboratory data, and substance use. Logistic regression was used to calculate crude and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Out of 636 patients, 62.7% were male, 72.9% were 30 years old, and 28.3% had a history of drug injection. Median CD4 was 132 cells/mm3, and 34.9% were clinical stage IV. Active cigarette smoking was reported by 36.3% with 14.0% smoking >10 cigarettes per day. Alcohol consumption was reported by 20.1% with 6.1% having 5 drinks per event. Overall 53.0% had a VL >100,000 cp/ml. Male gender, low body weight, low CD4 count, prior TB, and cigarette smoking were associated with high VL. Those who smoked 1±10 cigarettes per day were more likely to have high VL (aOR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.15±3.45), while the smaller number of patients who smoked >10 cigarettes per day had a non-significant trend toward higher VL (aOR = 1.41, 95% CI = 0.75±2.66). Alcohol consumption was not significantly associated with high VL. Tobacco use is increasingly recognized as a contributor to premature morbidity and mortality among HIV-infected patients. In our study, cigarette smoking in the last 30 days was associated with a 1.5 to 2-fold higher odds of having an HIV VL >100,000 cp/ml among patients presenting for ART.

Following the cycle's premiere in 1904 it was issued in two separate books, each gathering stylistically different songs. Though a credible case for narrative coherence has been advanced in numerous accounts, the cycle's peculiar amalgamation of materials might rather be read as a signal to its projection of multiple voices, which unsettle the longstanding critical tendency to map a single protagonist through its progress. The division marked by the cycle's publication history may productively be understood to reflect a tension inherent in its aesthetic propositions, one constitutive of much of Vaughan Williams's work, which frequently mediates between the individualistic and the collective, the ""artistic"" and the ""accessible,"" and, as I suggest, the subjective voice of the individual artist in its invitation to the participation of a singing and listening community. I propose that Vaughan Williams's early songs frequently frame the idea or demand the engagement of a listener's contribution, as particular modes of singing and listening-and singing-as-listening-are figured and invited within the music's constitution. Composed as he was searching for an individual creative voice that simultaneously sustained a nascent commitment to the social utility and intelligibility of national art music, these songs explore the possibility of achieving a self-consciously collective authorial subjectivity, often reaching toward a musical intersubjectivity wherein boundaries between self and other-and between composer, performer, and listener-are collapsed. In the recognition of such processes lies a means of examining the tendency of Vaughan Williams's work toward projecting a powerfully subjective voice that simultaneously claims identification with no single agency. © 2017 by the Regents of the University of California.

Tensile tests from room temperature to 120°C and interlaminar shear strength tests at room temperature were first conducted to investigate the mechanical behavior of the laminated carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic sheets. Furthermore, with a view to increase the formability, in this study, a state-of-the-art drawing process for laminated carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic sheets at an elevated temperature was investigated, and the drawing ratio was also determined for the case of elliptical cup drawing. To achieve this, the relation between the punch load and stroke, and the distribution of thickness were determined by measurement. To clarify the forming behavior in this case, evaluation of the effect of increasing the number of drawing steps was performed to investigate the deformation history. The microstructures showed reduced delamination with increasing radius of the punch.

Initially, defined as aggregates formed by embryonal carcinoma cells, EBs gained more prominence after the derivation of karyotypically normal embryonic stem cells from early mouse blastocysts. In many cases, formation of EBs constitutes an important initial step in directed differentiation protocols aimed at generated specific cell types from undifferentiated stem cells. Indeed state-of-the-art protocols for directed differentiation of cardiomyocytes still rely on this initial EB step. Analyses of spontaneous differentiation of embryonic stem cells in EBs have yielded important insights into the molecules that direct primitive endoderm differentiation and many of the lessons we have learned about the signals and transcription factors governing this differentiation event is owed to EB models, which later were extensively validated in studies of early mouse embryos. EBs show a degree of self-organization that mimics some aspects of early embryonic development, but with important exceptions. Recent studies that employ modern signaling reporters and tracers of lineage commitment have revealed both the strengths and the weaknesses of EBs as a model of embryonic axis formation. In this review, we discuss the history, application, and future potential of EBs as an experimental model. WIREs Dev Biol 2017, 6:e259. doi: 10.1002/wdev.259.

The difficulties endemic to this system have been foundational to the advent and growth of the hip-hop culture and the art form of rap, which has emerged as being of central importance to the dissemination of hip hop's language and symbolism. The rap artist Kendrick Lamar, in his masterful record To Pimp a Butterfly, seeks to elucidate the black experience in the United States by describing the manner in which the threat of death always affects the way African Americans view their lives. In addition, on the album, Lamar celebrates the ability of members of the African-American community to courageously face this danger while still declaring power and strength within their race. This experience of the omnipresence of death and the determination to live life from within that shadow mirrors the theological system employed by the existentialist theologian Paul Tillich.

As these empires diverged from their Greco-Roman roots between 700 and 1000 A.D. and established distinctive medieval artistic traditions, cosmic imagery created a web of visual continuity, though local meanings of these images varied greatly. Benjamin Anderson uses thrones, tables, mantles, frescoes, and manuscripts to show how cosmological motifs informed relationships between individuals, especially the ruling elite, and communities, demonstrating how domestic and global politics informed the production and reception of these depictions. The first book to consider such imagery across the dramatically diverse cultures of Western Europe, Byzantium, and the Islamic Middle East, Cosmos and Community in Early Medieval Art illuminates the distinctions between the cosmological art of these three cultural spheres, and reasserts the centrality of astronomical imagery to the study of art history. © 2017 by Benjamin Anderson.

Autoimmune diseases affect approximately 7-10% of the population of the United States, while more than 50,000,000 American adults suffer from some type of arthritis. The Heart in Rheumatic, Autoimmune and Inflammatory Diseases examines the complex mechanisms relating to cardiac diseases from a pathophysiological and clinical point of view. Autoimmune rheumatic diseases can affect the coronary vessels, myocardium, pericardium, heart valves and the conduction system. The diagnosis of these unique cardiac complications necessitates medical awareness and a high index of suspicion. Increased risk of advanced atherosclerosis plays a pivotal role in the development of cardiac diseases in systemic, rheumatic and autoimmune illnesses. Yet, other complex immune medicated mechanisms may contribute to the pathogenesis. Patients' optimal care requires coordination between the primary caregiver, the rheumatologist, immunologist and cardiologist. Screening for cardiovascular risk factors, recognition of high-risk patients and identification of subclinical cardiac conditions are of great importance. Moreover, regulation of inflammation, as well as abnormal immune responses and the initiation of early treatments should be the focus of patient management. A continuous attempt to identify novel therapeutic targets and change the natural history of the underlying disease and its cardiac manifestations is in progress. The book aims at providing the readers with a state of the art collection of up to date information regarding clinically important topics based on experts' perspectives.

Methods: A prospective cohort study was developed. Data were collected on subfertile patients who conceived after IVF/ICSI treatment. All demographic and clinical data were recorded. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Y and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support at 22 and 32 weeks of gestation and 15 days after delivery were completed. Data were analyzed comparing patients who conceived at their first IVF/ICSI cycle, after one unsuccessful ARTs cycle, and after multiple unsuccessful IVF/ICSI cycles. Results: A significant increase in state anxiety and depression scores from 22 gestational weeks of gestation to 15 days after delivery was observed in patients who received multiple unsuccessful IVF/ICSI cycles compared with other groups. No significant difference in perceived social support was detected among groups. The differences in depression and anxiety scores remained consistent after controlling for perceived social support. Discussion: A history of unsuccessful IVF/ICSI treatments seems to leave women more vulnerable in facing the duties of the new parental role. Such possibility underlies the importance of the availability of a psychological support for these women, even after a successful medical treatment for infertility. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group","Anxiety; ART; depression; infertility; pregnancy; social support",,2-s2.0-85013487485

Understanding the efficacy of novel interventions aimed at curing HIV requires characterization of both natural viral control and the effect of ART on viral control after treatment interruption. Design: Analysis of transient viral control in recent seroconverters in the Short Pulse AntiRetroviral Therapy at Acute Seroconversion trial. Methods: We compared untreated and treated HIV seroconverters (n=292) and identified periods of control (plasma HIV RNA&lt;400 copies/ml for ≥16 weeks off therapy) in 7.9%of ART-naive participants, and in 12.0%overall. HIVDNA was measured by qPCR, andHIV-specificCD8+ responses weremeasured by enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent spot assay (ELISpot). T-cell activation and exhaustion were measured by flow cytometry. Results: At baseline, future controllers had lower HIV DNA, lower plasma HIV RNA, higher CD4+ :CD8+ ratios (all P&lt;0.001) and higher CD4+ cell counts (P&lt;0.05) than noncontrollers. Among controllers, the only difference between the untreated and those who received ART was higher baseline HIV RNA in the latter (P=0.003), supporting an added ART effect. Conclusion: Consideration of spontaneous remission in untreated individuals will be critical to avoid overestimating the effect size of new interventions used in HIV cure studies. © Copyright 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of previous history of operatively diagnosed endometriosis on pregnancy outcomes. Methods: A total of 98 primiparous women who had been diagnosed with endometriosis by previous laparoscopic surgery were included in this retrospective cohort study. Pregnancy outcomes were compared between these women (study group) who had a live birth and 300 women without endometriosis (control group) who had a live birth. In the study group, the pregnancy outcomes of 74 women who conceived naturally (no assisted reproductive technology [ART] subgroup) were simultaneously compared with 24 women who conceived by ART (ART subgroup). Results: Miscarriage was observed in 23 of 98 women with endometriosis (23.5%). There were 75 women who had a live birth after laparoscopic diagnosis of endometriosis in the study group eventually. On multivariate analysis, the postpartum hemorrhage rate increased significantly in the study group when compared with the control group (adjusted odds ratio: 2.265, 95% confidence interval: 1.062, 4.872; P = 0.034). There was an upward tendency of developing other pregnancy-related complications, such as preterm birth, placental abruption, placenta previa, cesarean section, fetal distress/anemia, and others in the study group than in the control group. However, the differences showed no statistical significance. Within the study group, the occurrence rate of postpartum hemorrhage and preterm birth was both higher in the ART subgroup than in the no ART subgroup. The differences both had statistical significance (44.4% vs. 17.5%, P = 0.024 and 27.8% vs. 1.8%, P = 0.010, respectively). At the same time, median (interquartile range) for gestational age at delivery in the ART subgroup was significantly shorter than that in the no ART subgroup (38 weeks [36-39 weeks] vs. 39 weeks [38-40 weeks]; P = 0.005). Conclusions: Endometriosis may affect obstetric outcomes. Women with endometriosis have a higher risk of postpartum hemorrhage.

In contrast to a ‘field recording’ approach to the environment, Landscape Quartet devised participative and improvisatory approaches to making sound art in and with the landscape. The paper analyses the author's work related to the group from a predominantly phenomenological perspective, and draws on authors from geography, philosophy and anthropology to interrogate the experiences of working in this way. That landscapes are dynamic and temporal phenomena is congruent with the forms of musical activity, but this congruency is not without its problems. The history of landscape study is highly visually oriented, and there is a danger of transposing assumptions from visual approaches onto the sonic. However, the paper also refuses a phonocentric approach, arguing that Ingold’s insistence on the intersensorial nature of landscape experience is essential to fully account for environmental sound art. © 2017 Landscape Research Group Ltd","artistic research; Improvisation; landscape; participation; sound",,2-s2.0-85013188420

This book is the first comprehensive analysis of Tertullian's attitude towards the foetus and embryo. Examining Tertullian's works in light of Roman literary and social history, Julian Barr proposes that Tertullian's comments on the unborn should be read as rhetoric ancillary to his primary arguments. Tertullian's engagement in the art of rhetoric also explains his tendency towards self-contradiction. He argued that human existence began at conception in some treatises and not in others. Tertullian's references to the unborn hence should not be plucked out of context, lest they be misread. Tertullian borrowed, modified, and discarded theories of ensoulment according to their usefulness for individual treatises. So long as a single work was internally consistent, Tertullian was satisfied. He elaborated upon previous Christian traditions and selectively borrowed from ancient embryological theory to prove specific theological and moral points. Tertullian was more influenced by Roman custom than he would perhaps have admitted, since the contrast between pagan and Christian attitudes on abortion was more rhetorical than real. © 2017 Julian Barr.

These techniques return to the user a set of RTL locations where a change can correct erroneous behavior. However, each location must be manually investigated. This problem is exacerbated by the increasing amount of failures in the modern regression verification cycle. Recent work in clustering-based revision debugging mitigates this cost by ranking revisions based on their likelihood of having introduced an error. This work presents a perceptron-based approach to revision debugging that can be extended to leverage the revision history of a design directly. Perceptrons are trained using labeled revisions from the design history. They are then used to predict the probability that a revision has introduced an error. The proposed methodology performs competitively with the state-of-the-art, but can be extended to handle more features. This allows for an automated regression debug flow integrated with Version Control and Issue Tracking Systems. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Automation; Computer aided design; Errors; Automated debugging; Debug flow; Design history; Issue Tracking; State of the art; Version control; Program debugging",2-s2.0-85015316061

Implementation of this policy will lead to an increased incidence of ART-related adverse effects, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Is the region yet ready to cope with such a challenging issue? Main body: The introduction and widespread use of ART have drastically changed the natural history of HIV/AIDS, but exposure to ART leads to serious medication-related adverse effects mainly explained by mitochondrial toxicities, and the situation will get worse in the near future. Indeed, ART is associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, lipodystrophy, prediabetes and overt diabetes, insulin resistance and hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis. The prevalence of these disorders is already high in SSA, and the situation will be exacerbated by the implementation of the new WHO recommendations. Most SSA countries are characterized by (extreme) poverty, very weak health systems, inadequate and low quality of health services, inaccessibility to existing health facilities, lack of (qualified) health personnel, lack of adequate equipment, inaccessibility and unaffordability of medicines, and heavy workload in a context of a double burden of disease. Additionally, there is dearth of data on the incidence and predictive factors of ART-related adverse effects in SSA, to anticipate on strategies that should be put in place to prevent the occurrence of these conditions or properly estimate the upcoming burden and prepare an adequate response plan. These are required if we are to anticipate and effectively prevent this upcoming burden. Conclusion: While SSA would be the first region to experience the huge benefits of implementing the ""test and treat"" policy of the WHO, the region is not yet prepared to manage the consequential increased burden of ART-related toxic and metabolic complications. Urgent measures should be taken to fill the lacunae if SSA is not to become over-burdened by the consequences of the ""test and treat"" policy. © 2017 The Author(s).","90-90-90; Antiretroviral therapy; HIV/AIDS; Sub-Saharan Africa; Test and treat","antiretrovirus agent; anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; Africa south of the Sahara; antiretroviral therapy; cardiovascular disease; diabetes mellitus; dysglycemia; dyslipidemia; health care policy; health care quality; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; hyperlactatemia; hypertension; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin resistance; lactic acidosis; lipodystrophy; Note; pancreatitis; poverty; prevalence; priority journal; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; adverse effects; highly active antiretroviral therapy; HIV Infections; virology; world health organization; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Africa South of the Sahara; Anti-HIV Agents; Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active; Health Policy; HIV Infections; Humans; Poverty; Prevalence; World Health Organization",2-s2.0-85012883739

These carpentry works are magnificent examples of the Mudéjar art made in Spain in the early 16th century. Portable X-ray fluorescence gave good information on the different components of the polychrome. The SEM-EDX study of the surfaces of small samples gave information on their components and also characterized the compounds that had been deposited or formed by environmental contamination or by the alteration of some pigments. The SEM-EDX study of cross-sections facilitated the characterization of all layers and pigments from the support to the most external layer. The following pigments were characterized: red (cinnabar/vermillion, lead oxide, iron oxides and orpiment/realgar), black (carbon black), white (white lead and titanium barium white), yellow-orange-red-brown (orpiment/realgar and iron oxides), green (chromium oxide), blue (indigo blue and ultramarine blue), and gilding (gold leaf on bole). False gold, bronze and brass were also found. The pigments were applied with the oil painting technique over a support layer that had been primed with animal glue. This support layer was gypsum in some cases and white lead in others.

In this paper, we propose a novel sparse representation based visual tracking algorithm, which well integrates the temporal and spatial context information of tracking objects into a unified framework. Specifically, we compute the similarity between the target and its candidates, which is acquired by fusing three aspects of the target's appearance variation with different weights. For the first part, we apply a patch based sparse representation to measure the similarities between the target in the first frame and candidates in current frame. Since the tracking result in the last frame provides the latest variation information of the target, we employ an image quality assessment method to obtain the similarity scores in the second part, and the spatial context information is also exploited. As the target appearance may suffer from radical changes along the video sequence, tracking that only uses the two parts mentioned above will suffer from serious drifting problems and easily cause incorrect tracking results. In order to ease this problem, we exploit the temporal context information by generating a group of history target templates adaptively according to previous tracking results, computing similarities between each candidate with them and the maximum will be used in the third part. Finally, we combine these parts to calculate the similarity scores and take those candidates with the highest score as the new targets in current frames. The extensive experiments on twelve challenging video sequences show that our algorithm can achieve performance competitive with state-of-the-art trackers. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Context information; Sparse representation; Visual tracking","Rapid thermal annealing; Semantics; Tracking (position); Video recording; Context information; Image quality assessment; Similarity scores; Sparse representation; Temporal and spatial; Unified framework; Visual Tracking; Visual tracking algorithm; Target tracking; algorithm; Article; context information; controlled study; eye tracking; image analysis; image quality; information; light intensity; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; sparse representation; spatiotemporal analysis; statistical parameters",2-s2.0-85006728115

It has a negative effect on the quality of life of HIV patients and progression of the HIV disease. In the sub-Saharan African setting, including Ethiopia where both HIV infection and under-nutrition are expected to be high, there is a paucity of data on the matter. This study was aimed to reveal the magnitude and factors associated with anemia among adult HIV patients in Debre-Tabor Hospital, northwest Ethiopia. Methods: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was used among adult HIV patients in Debre-Tabor Hospital from April 1 to May 30, 2015. The diagnosis of anemia was made following the 2011 World Health Organization recommendation on hemoglobin cut-off points. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression was carried out to assess factors associated with anemia. Results: A total of 377 patients’ charts were reviewed. Most of the participants (n=237, 62.9%) were taking antiretroviral treatment (ART). The overall prevalence of anemia was 23% (95% CI: 19.1, 27.6). Being ART-naïve (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 3.37; 95% CI: 1.59, 7.14), having treatment history with anti-tuberculosis (TB) drug (AOR: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.19, 8.67), taking zidovudine (ZDV)-containing ART regimen (AOR: 2.14; 95% CI: 1.03, 4.57), and having recent CD4+ T-lymphocytes count of <200 cells/μL (AOR: 2.13; 95% CI: 1.04, 4.36) were associated with occurrence of anemia among adult HIV patients. Conclusion and recommendation: Anemia continues to be a major co-morbidity among adult HIV patients in Ethiopia. Adult HIV patients who are taking ZDV-containing ART, with a history of TB treatment, have a low CD4+T-lymphocytes count and are ART-naïve should be carefully screened and treated for anemia. © 2017 Melese et al.","Anemia; Antiretroviral treatment; Ethiopia; HIV/AIDS; ZDV toxicity","antiretrovirus agent; tuberculostatic agent; zidovudine; adolescent; adult; age distribution; anemia; Article; CD4 lymphocyte count; comorbidity; controlled study; cross-sectional study; educational status; Ethiopia; female; follow up; geographic distribution; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; major clinical study; male; marriage; prevalence; quantitative analysis; sex difference",2-s2.0-85021229515

Assessing the composition of the original materials purchased by artists can guide not only their identification in works of art, but also their restoration and conservation. Advances in characterisation methods and models for data interpretation are particularly important in studying organic coloring materials in the transition period corresponding to the late 19th-early 20th century, when many such variants or combinations were hypothetically possible in their formulations. There is thus a need for reliable databases of materials introduced in that period and for gaining chemical knowledge at a molecular level related to modern organic pigments, by state-of-the-art protocols. This paper reports on the results of a study on 44 samples of historical colorants in powder and paint tubes, containing both lake pigments and synthetic organic pigments dating from 1890 to 1926. The samples were collected at the Lefranc Archive in Le Mans (France) as a part of Project Futurahma ""From Futurism to Classicism (1910-1922). Research, Art History and Material Analysis"", (FIRB2012, Italian Ministry of University and Research), and were investigated using an analytical approach based on chromatographic and mass spectrometric techniques. The focus of the chemical analyses was to reveal the composition of the historical organic lake pigments including minor components, to discriminate between different recipes for the extraction of chromophore-containing molecules from the raw materials, and ultimately to distinguish between different formulations and recipes. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with diode array detector (DAD) or electrospray-Quadrupole-Time of Flight tandem mass spectrometry detector (ESI-Q-ToF) were chosen given their considerable capacity to identify such complex and widespread organic materials. Although the inorganic components of the pigments were not taken into account in this survey, the specific molecular profiles provided invaluable information on the extraction procedures or synthetic strategy followed by the different producers, at different times. For instance, the use of Kopp's purpurin and garancine was highlighted, and synthetic by-products were identified. The results provided evidence that the addition of synthetic organic pigments to paint mixtures started from 1910 onwards, but they also suggest that in the formulation of high quality (surfin) colorants, natural products were still preferred. Moreover, in one of the samples the use of murexide as the colouring material was confirmed. This paper presents the first systematic and comprehensive survey on organic lakes and pigments belonging to an historical archive, by both HPLC-DAD and HPLC-ESI-Q-ToF. Specific by-products of synthetic production of pigments, which can act as specific molecular markers for dating or locating a work of art, were also identified for the first time. © 2017 The Author(s).","Alizarin synthesis; Colorants; Historical industrial pigments; HPLC-DAD; HPLC-Q-ToF; Lakes; Organic pigments; Synthetic",,2-s2.0-85013301567

Providing an ensemble of good matched reservoir models from history matching is essential to reproduce the observed production data from a field and to forecast reservoir performance. The nature of history matching is multi-objective because there are multiple match criteria or misfit from different production data, wells and regions in the field. In many cases, these criteria are conflicting and can be handled by the multi-objective approach. Moreover, multi-objective provides faster misfit convergence and more robust towards stochastic nature of optimization algorithms. However, reservoir history matching may feature far too many objectives that can be efficiently handled by conventional multi-objective algorithms, such as multi-objective particle swarm optimizer (MOPSO) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II). Under an increasing number of objectives, the performance of multi-objective history matching by these algorithms deteriorates (lower match quality and slower misfit convergence). In this work, we introduce a recently proposed algorithm for many-objective optimization problem, known as reference vector-guided evolutionary algorithm (RVEA), to history matching. We apply the algorithm to history matching a synthetic reservoir model and a real field case study with more than three objectives. The paper demonstrates the superiority of the proposed RVEA to the state of the art multi-objective history matching algorithms, namely MOPSO and NSGA II. © 2016 IEEE.","history matching; many-objective optimization; multi-objective optimization; reservoir simulation","Artificial intelligence; Evolutionary algorithms; Genetic algorithms; Intelligent control; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Petroleum industry; Petroleum reservoirs; Screening; Stochastic systems; Guided evolutionary algorithms; History matching; Many-objective optimizations; Multi-objective particle swarm optimizer; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii (NSGA II); Reservoir history matching; Reservoir simulation; Synthetic reservoir models; Reservoir management",2-s2.0-85016067715

Two main features are involved in model operations, namely, the space which is extracted from the collected GPS data and also the time which is extracted from the associated timestamps. The internal representation of space and time features is extracted automatically in the proposed model rather than relying on handcraft representation. This enables the model to discover the useful knowledge about people behaviour in more efficient way. Due to the ability of RNN structure to represent the sequences, it is utilized in the proposed model in order to keep track of user movement history. These tracks help the model to discover more meaningful dependencies and as consequence, enhancing the model performance. The results show that STF-RNN model provides good improvements in predicting people's next location compared with the state-of-the-art models when applied on a large real life dataset from Geo-life project. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Artificial intelligence; Recurrent neural networks; Internal representation; Mobility pattern; Model performance; Modeling operation; Movement-based; Space and time; Space-time features; State of the art; Forecasting",2-s2.0-85015981385

However, no single DE algorithm has consistently been the best for solving a wide range of them. In the literature, this drawback has been tackled by using multiple DE operators in a single framework. However, utilizing a problem's landscape in the design of an efficient selection mechanism to emphasize the best-performing DE variant has not yet been thoroughly explored. Motivated by this fact, in this paper, a new two-phase (exploration and exploitation) multi-operator DE algorithm is proposed. It starts with the exploration phase, dynamically placing emphasis on the best-performing DE based on two landscape indicators and its performance history, and then repeats this process during the exploitation phase. To judge the performance of this algorithm, a variety of real-world optimization problems taken from different disciplines are solved. According to the results obtained, this algorithm shows superior performance to those of state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2016 IEEE.","differential evolution; landscape indicators; multi-operator; real-world problems","Artificial intelligence; Evolutionary algorithms; Problem solving; Differential Evolution; Exploration and exploitation; Landscape indicators; Multi operators; Optimization problems; Real-world optimization; Real-world problem; State-of-the-art algorithms; Optimization",2-s2.0-85016078662

Therefore, this paper proposes a state-of-the-art method which combines FTS and LCS/LRS to predict stock prices. This method is based on the principle that history will repeat itself. It uses different interval lengths in FTS to fuzzify the prices, and LCS/LRS to look for the same pattern in the historical prices to predict future stock prics. In the experiment, we examine various intervals of fuzzy time sets in order to achieve high prediction accuracy. The proposed method outperforms traditional methods in terms of prediction accuracy and, furthermore, it is easy to implement. © 2016 IEEE.","Fuzzy time series; Longest common/repeated subsequence; TAIEX forecasting","Costs; Cybernetics; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Investments; Time series; Fuzzy time series; Fuzzy time series (FTS); Longest common/repeated subsequence; Prediction accuracy; State-of-the-art methods; Stock forecasting; Stock price; Stock price forecasting; Forecasting",2-s2.0-85015727511

I travel for travel's sake. The great affair is to move. "" Taking up the concepts of time, place, and memory, the contributors to this collection explore in what ways the dynamic view of life suggested by this quotation permeates Stevenson's work. The essays adopt a wide variety of critical approaches, including post-colonial theory, post-structuralism, new historicism, art history, and philosophy, making use of the vast array of literary materials that Stevenson left across a global journey that began in Scotland in 1850 and ended in Samoa in 1894. These range from travel journals, letters, and classic literary staples such as Treasure Island and The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, to rarely read masterpieces such as The Master of Ballantrae or The Ebb-Tide. While much recent scholarship on Stevenson foregrounds geography, the present volume also examines the theme of movement across memory, time, and generic boundaries. Taken together, the essays offer a view of Stevenson that demonstrates how the protean nature of his literary output reflects the radical developments in science, technology, and culture that characterized the age in which he lived. © 2017 selection and editorial matter, Richard J.

High quality QAC substantially improves search experiences by helping users in typing less while submitting the queries. Many studies have been proposed to improve quality and relevance of the QAC methods from different perspectives, including leveraging contexts in long term and short term query histories, investigating the temporal information for time-sensitive QAC, and analyzing user behaviors. Although these studies have shown the context, temporal, and user behavior data carry valuable information, most existing QAC approaches do not fully exploit or even completely ignore these information. We propose a novel Hawkes process based QAC algorithm, comprehensively taking into account the context, temporal, and position of the clicked recommended query completions (a type of user behavior data), for reliable query completion prediction. Our understanding of ranking query completions is consistent with the mathematical rationale of Hawke process; such a coincidence in turn validates our motivation of using Hawkes process for QAC. We also develop an efficient inference algorithm to compute the optimal solutions of the proposed QAC algorithm. The proposed method is evaluated on two realworld benchmark data in comparison with state-of-art methods, and the obtained experiments clearly demonstrate their effectiveness. © 2017 ACM.","Contextual data; Hawkes process; Query autocompletion","Data mining; Inference engines; Information retrieval; Search engines; Websites; Contextual data; Inference algorithm; Optimal solutions; Parametric models; Prominent features; Query autocompletion; State-of-art methods; Temporal information; Behavioral research",2-s2.0-85015268212

Disrespect and abuse of individuals and providers in health services across the RMNCAH continuum must be stopped through collaborative, multi-tiered efforts. Call for collaboration: A new focus on health care quality in the Sustainable Development Goals offers an opportunity to seriously reexamine user experiences and their impact on health care utilization. The new framework provides an opening to redress the insidious problem of negative interactions with care across the RMNCAH services continuum and redraft the blueprint for service delivery and performance measurement, placing individuals and their needs at the center. Both the maternal health and family planning fields are at a turning point in their histories of defining and addressing individuals' experiences of care. In this commentary, we review these histories and the current state-of-the-art in both fields. Though the approaches and language in each sub-field vary, person-centered care principles related to the essential role of individuals' preferences, needs and values, and the importance of informed decision-making, respect, privacy and confidentiality, and non-discrimination, are integral to all. Promoting respectful, person-centered care also requires recognizing the factors that lead to poor treatment of clients, including gender norms and unsupportive working conditions for providers. Lessons can be learned from innovative efforts across the continuum to support health care providers to provide respectful, person-centered care. Conclusion: Efforts in the maternal health and family planning fields to define respectful, person-centered care provide a useful foundation from which to connect across the continuum of RMNCAH services. Now is the time to creatively work together to develop new approaches for promoting respectful treatment of individuals in all RMNCAH services. © 2017 The Author(s).","Collaboration; Family planning; Interpersonal relations; Maternal health; Patient centered care; Quality of health care","adolescent; child; child health care; confidentiality; decision making; family planning; female; friend; gender; health care delivery; health care personnel; health care quality; health care utilization; human; human experiment; language; male; maternal welfare; newborn; patient care; privacy; sustainable development; work environment; family planning; maternal welfare; patient attitude; patient care; standards; Adolescent; Family Planning Services; Female; Humans; Maternal Health; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Patient-Centered Care; Quality of Health Care",2-s2.0-85011310531

The polemical diagnosis claims that because the arts are no longer able to express a collective subjectivity, they have become socially irrelevant. In a more redemptive gesture, Worringer then proposes that sensuous criticism of past art will replace art itself, since criticism now channels Germany’s creative energy and serves the former social functions of art. This article historically contextualizes this new form of criticism as an intervention into the Methodenstreit (methodological debate) and the field of social energetics, two crucial discussions around 1900 on the future of the humanities. The article also shows that Worringer’s new criticism, which takes the form of the Denkbild (thought-image), attempts to fuse the discursive with the sensuous and visual. It thereby aims to reverse a modern trend toward increasingly abstract or conceptual thought. Criticism should instead rely on empathy for historical artworks, whose appreciation is meant to foster the public’s feeling of being at home in the world.

This new protocol seeks to identify the raw materials that were used, as well as reconstruct the different technical gestures and decision-making processes involved in the obtaining of these black pigments. For the first of these goals, the pictorial matter of the black figurative motifs documented at the Les Dogues rock art shelter (Ares del Maestre, CastelloÂn, Spain) was characterized through the combination of physicochemical and archeobotanical analyses. During the first stage of our research protocol, in situ and nondestructive analyses were carried out by means of portable Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence spectrometry (EDXRF); during the second stage, samples were analyzed by Optical Microscopy (OM), Raman spectroscopy, and Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX). Two major conclusions have been drawn from these analyses: first, charred plant matter has been identified as a main component of these prehistoric black pigments; and second, angiosperm and conifer charcoal was a primary raw material for pigment production, identified by means of the archaeobotanical study of plant cells. For the second goal, black charcoal pigments were replicated in the laboratory by using different raw materials and binders and by reproducing two main chaõÃnes opeÂratoires. The comparative study of the structure and preservation of plant tissues of both prehistoric and experimental pigments by means of SEM-EDX underlines both a complex preparation process and the use of likely pigment recipes, mixing raw material with fatty or oily binders. Finally, the formal and stylistic analysis of the motifs portrayed at Les Dogues allowed us to explore the relationship between identified stylistic phases and black charcoal pigment use, raising new archaeological questions concerning the acquisition of know-how and the transfer of traditionally learned chaõÃnes opeÂratoires in Spanish Levantine rock art. © 2017 Lopez-Montalvo et al.

These contributions range from the valuation of art goods by the art matrix we conceived, to the valuation of the cultural welfare of nations, regions and local communities. Our work also assessed the provision of cultural welfare at the national, regional and local level for the public and non-profit sectors and measured the efficiency and effectiveness of museum bureaucracies. We also studied the profitability of investments in the arts by considering product life cycles, artistic movements and economies. More recently, with Michele Caputo, we focused on the long-run life cycle and success of the movie industry for select countries competing with foreign movie industries and TV entertainment by adopting Caputo’s fractional derivatives theory, which captures the role of past history. Professor Forte and I also developed the Differential Touristic Development Index to measure the effects of art and cultural enterprises as tourist attractions. The most innovative contributions of Francesco Forte to the measurement of the economic value of cultural goods and services demonstrate that it is possible to “measure the unmeasured,” and therein improve public collection of statistical data with the goal of increasing the preservation and valuation of cultural goods and services and highlighting their potential as economic multipliers. © 2017, The Author(s).","Artwork evaluation; Endogenous and exogenous variables; Investment in visual arts; Method fuzzy; Product cycle theory",,2-s2.0-85011629868

An ethnic German (although born in Switzerland) and a German citizen, he was persecuted by the Nazi government on political rather than racial grounds because of his allegedly “degenerate” artistic style. Dismissed from his teaching position, he emigrated to Switzerland in 1933; shortly afterward he became ill with systemic sclerosis and struggled with this condition for the remaining years of his life. Many publications have examined the effect of social rejection and illness on his art, but the present study considers the effect of these adversities on Klee’s attitude toward his fellow humans. After being an extreme misanthrope in his early adult years, he developed an attitude of cosmic indifference toward humanity during the First World War, which he then maintained until the end of 1939. Although his rejection by Germany had been a significant emotional blow, it was the physical suffering caused by his illness that led him, at the end of his life, to show compassion toward the suffering of other individuals. In this he was like tragic figures such as King Lear who learned from their great misfortunes to value humanity. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","compassion; illness and art; misanthropy; Paul Klee; systemic sclerosis","art; Germany; history; painting; public figure; Switzerland; systemic sclerosis; Famous Persons; Germany; History, 20th Century; Medicine in Art; Paintings; Scleroderma, Systemic; Switzerland",2-s2.0-85011954213

The main objective of this practice-led project is mostly about changing the general perspective that Western art is not about ‘learning’ art history but more about ‘understanding’ art story. By understanding the fundamental story of art, students will be able to relate the context of Western cultures into their design content. As a result, students manage to apply their knowledge into their artworks by creating illustrations based on specific Western art contexts, colours, and themes. They are also able to apply some famous paintings or artworks from Western art periods into new artworks by using different materials and techniques such as quilled paper art.

While ‘fast’ strategies allow for rapid increase in population size and limit vulnerability to stochastic events, ‘slow’ strategies and bet-hedging may reduce variance in vital rates in response to stochasticity. We test these predictions using biological invasions since founder alien populations start small, compiling the largest dataset yet of global herpetological introductions and life history traits. Using state-of-the-art phylogenetic comparative methods, we show that successful invaders have fast traits, such as large and frequent clutches, at both establishment and spread stages. These results, together with recent findings in mammals and plants, support ‘fast advantage’ models and the importance of high potential population growth rate. Conversely, successful alien birds are bet-hedgers. We propose that transient population dynamics and differences in longevity and behavioural flexibility can help reconcile apparently contrasting results across terrestrial vertebrate classes. © 2017 The Authors.

The generally accepted notion of mandatory laparotomy for all penetrating abdominal injuries was among those norms being called into question across the country and many advocated expectant management of selected patients presenting with this type of injury. Leaders of the surgical community published opinions on either side of the argument. The house staff at Charity Hospital during this period was among the busiest in the nation in treating these injuries, many of them inmates of the Louisiana State Penitentiary who used self-inflicted stab wounds to the abdomen as a means of temporary respite from the inhumane conditions in the prison. Inspired, in part, by the overabundance of negative laparotomies among this group, F. Carter Nancewent on to systematically challenge the standard of care. This effort constitutes one of the major forces for change of the surgical dogma ofmandatory laparotomy for all abdominal stab wounds.

During the Weimar Republic, he became a driving force behind a museum reform movement promoting a policy for arts and culture that supported the collection of contemporary art in German museums. After Adolf Hitler's rise to power, Gurlitt had to step down from his museum role. He started a career as an art dealer, first independently and later on behalf of Hitler himself.

A Swedish surgeon, Ulf Fernström, was the pioneer of artificial disc replacement, and his contribution in the form of Fernström balls dramatically altered spinal surgery and technique by showing the proper technique and implant that should be used for areas requiring motion in many planes. History of the Artificial Disc Ulf Fernström created his artificial disc inspired by the movement of the hip and knee joints. His implants attempted to restore disc spacing and articulation in patients who had failed conservative measures of treatment. Fernström balls were the first implants of their kind and represent the first attempt at artificial disc replacement. However, many surgeons and researchers questioned Fernström balls, claiming that their lack of elastic properties could damage patients. Conclusions Of the wide range of implants on the market for the intervertebral disc space, all designs and applications of products stem from the initial discovery made by Fernström, thus making him a pioneer in disc replacement. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial disk; Fernström ball; Spine; Ulf Fernström","arthroplasty; conservative treatment; discectomy; disk prosthesis; endoprosthesis; Fernstrom ball; hip; human; intervertebral articulation; intervertebral disk hernia; joint function; knee; orthopedic implant; patient satisfaction; patient selection; prosthesis implantation; prosthetic replacement; Review; spine implant; surgeon; art; devices; diagnostic imaging; history; Intervertebral Disc Displacement; intervertebral disk; neurosurgeon; prostheses and orthoses; total disc replacement; History, 20th Century; Humans; Intervertebral Disc; Intervertebral Disc Displacement; Neurosurgeons; Prostheses and Implants; Total Disc Replacement",2-s2.0-84998827955

Method: This article analyzes storytelling by means of a case study in the art of narrative as used in support of an organization, community, and industry. The organization is Y-12 National Security Complex, which makes parts for America’s nuclear arsenal and does research and production in nuclear materials for medicine, biology, industry, and nuclear energy and propulsion. The community is Oak Ridge, Tennessee and environs. “Industry” references the nuclear industry in Oak Ridge and beyond, including its partnership with the U.S. military. The subject of the case study—the person whose narrative art is here analyzed—is Ray Smith, official historian of Y-12. The material analyzed comes from publications by Smith, notes from interviews with him on multiple occasions, and many sessions of listening to his stories both in person and via recordings (documentaries, presentations available on web sites, etc.). Results: This study finds that Smith’s stories connected with the Manhattan Project, and the years preceding and succeeding it, constitute a model set of narratives displaying the rhetorical power of storytelling in an organizational setting. Conclusion: By studying the ways narrative is successfully used in professional settings, we deepen our understanding of rhetorical storytelling as well as our ability to use it. This skill has wide application to contexts of technical and professional communication. It can be used to elevate public opinion about a corporation, community, or industry; to breed confidence among consumers and investors; to construct leadership models for managers; to inspire and motivate employees—and in virtually any other sort of rhetorical enterprise. © 2017, Society for Technical Communication.

A three-volume revision was begun in 1937. Peters took on the task of revising Volumes I and II but never finished Volume II. His outspoken public advocacy for social reform, world peace, and universal health care made him a target in the era of McCarthyism. Three times between 1949 and 1953 he was brought before the Loyalty Review Board with charges of being a communist and a sympathetic supporter of subversive organizations.

This widely circulated book's central idea is that punishment as practiced in penal settings is an injustice amounting to a crime. At the outset, The Crime of Punishment quickly achieved national attention. Within mainstream psychology, its antipunishment message encountered a changed climate in which punishment, thought ineffective during the period 1930 through 1960, was redefined as an effective component in learning. It also met competition from the contemporaneous Stanford Prison Experiment (Haney, Banks, & Zimbardo, 1973), which quickly rose to equivalent media presence and superior disciplinary prominence. Both the Stanford Prison Experiment and The Crime of Punishment survived in the antireform era of hyperincarceration after 1974 as parallel examples of reform activism, one secular and one religious in character, illustrating some convergences of aim between psychology and psychiatry outside of specifically clinical issues. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","Karl Menninger; Prisons and prison reform; Psychiatry and psychology; Punishment; Religious and moral aspects of psychology","art; crime; history; human; prison; psychiatry; psychology; punishment; standards; United States; Crime; History, 20th Century; Humans; Prisons; Psychiatry; Punishment; United States",2-s2.0-85001130824

Notably, although the Gray–Agassiz debate has become one of the most thoroughly studied scientific debates, historians of science remain unable to answer one critical question: How was Gray able to acquire specimens from Japan? Making use of previously unknown archival materials, this article scrutinizes the institutional, instrumental, financial, and military settings that enabled Gray’s collector, Charles Wright (1811–1885), to travel to Japan, as well as examine Wright’s collecting practices in Japan. I argue that it is necessary to examine Gray’s diagnosis of Japan’s flora and the subsequent debate about it from the viewpoint of field sciences.

The identification of immune correlates of risk for TB disease could help in the design of hostdirected therapies and clinical management. This study aimed to identify innate immune correlates of TB recurrence in HIV+ ART-treated individuals with a history of previous successful TB treatment. Methods: Twelve participants with a recurrent episode of TB (cases) were matched for age, sex, time on ART, pre-ART CD4 count with 12 participants who did not develop recurrent TB in 60 months of follow-up (controls). Cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells from time-points before TB recurrence were stimulated with ligands for Toll-like receptors (TLR) including TLR-2, TLR-4, and TLR-7/8. Multicolor flow cytometry and intracellular cytokine staining were used to detect IL-1b, TNF-a, IL-12, and IP10 responses from monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs). Results: Elevated production of IL-1b from monocytes following TLR-2, TLR-4, and TLR-7/8 stimulation was associated with reduced odds of TB recurrence. In contrast, production of IL-1b from both monocytes and mDCs following Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) stimulation was associated with increased odds of TB recurrence (risk of recurrence increased by 30% in monocytes and 42% in mDCs, respectively). Conclusion: Production of IL-1b by innate immune cells following TLR and BCG stimulations correlated with differential TB recurrence outcomes in ART-treated patients and highlights differences in host response to TB. © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","HIV/TB coinfection; Monocytes; Myeloid dendritic cells; TB recurrence; Toll-like receptor","anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; CD14 antigen; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; glycoprotein p 15095; HLA DR antigen; interleukin 12; interleukin 1beta; toll like receptor; toll like receptor 2; toll like receptor 4; toll like receptor 7; toll like receptor 8; tuberculostatic agent; tumor necrosis factor; antiretrovirus agent; CXCL10 protein, human; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; IL12A protein, human; interleukin 12p35; interleukin 1beta; toll like receptor; tumor necrosis factor; adult; antiretroviral therapy; Article; CD4 lymphocyte count; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; cryopreservation; cytokine production; female; flow cytometry; follow up; human; human cell; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; innate immunity; lung tuberculosis; male; mixed infection; monocyte; myeloid dendritic cell; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; priority journal; prospective study; recurrent infection; virus load; case control study; cell culture; complication; HIV Infections; immunology; metabolism; middle aged; mononuclear cell; recurrent disease; tuberculosis; young adult; Adult; Anti-Retroviral Agents; Case-Control Studies; Cells, Cultured; Chemokine CXCL10; Female; Flow Cytometry; HIV Infections; Humans; Interleukin-12 Subunit p35; Interleukin-1beta; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Male; Middle Aged; Recurrence; Toll-Like Receptors; Tuberculosis; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84988575837

Focusing on anatomical images produced over the long eighteenth century, this essay argues that such a history must begin by examining those historical instances in which conventions of anatomical representation are rigorously challenged. Such breaches in anatomy’s pictorial culture provide insight into the evolving relationship between picturing and knowledge. Shifts in perspective and representational conventions do not merely reflect changes in scientifi c thought. Rather, they act as catalysts for re-conceptualizing the interaction between looking, investigating and representing. This is true of the new approach to anatomical engraving represented in published works by Govard Bidloo, William Hunter and John Bell. Emphasizing the graphic details of the anatomy theatre over the idealized, normative image associated with Andreas Vesalius, these books helped construct the very idea of scientifi c representation. © Association of Art Historians 2016.",,,2-s2.0-85006724971

The region's contemporary art has been pulled, sometimes unwillingly, into those national frameworks, even as it enters a global market and takes part in a more transnational dialogue. What is the geography proper to contemporary art? And what insights might a regional perspective afford about art that speaks to a world beyond the nation, but resists outright assimilation under the rubric of 'the global'? This essay proposes a calibration of three art historical frames national, regional and international. I argue that far from meaning transcendence of national frames, even where artists intend it, contemporaneity compounds and complicates them. I examine two specific manifestations of contemporaneity, one that emerged at the height of the Cold War in the work of a Sino-Thai modernist, Chang Sae-tang; the other in the broaching of Cold War trauma in art and film of the 'post-historical' twenty-first century. Neither 'contemporary' can be understood without its respective national framing, but that framing alone proves inadequate for describing the complex histories, subjectivities, and formal choices with which Southeast Asian artists have grappled. If studies of modern art demanded recourse to specific national histories, the study of contemporary art will require no less specific histories of the international. © 2017 ARTMargins and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","Abstraction; Chang Sae-tang; Cold War; Contemporary art; Nationalism; Regionalism; Southeast Asia",,2-s2.0-85014141935

Our objectives were: to summarize the epidemiological, physiological, psychopathological literature about the relation between AN and manifestations of depression, and to focus on the clinical trial data assessing the use of antidepressant medication in AN in order to clarify the strategy for the use of antidepressant in AN during adolescence. Method A manual computerised search (Medline) was performed for relevant published studies assessing the association between depressive signs or Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and AN. Another manual computerised search (Medline) listed clinical trials assessing antidepressant in AN. Results On the one hand, depressive symptoms are common during the course of AN and could have different meaning. Indeed, firstly, we can distinguish symptoms that are inherent to AN and which can be mistaken for depressive signs (for instance: low self-esteem, reduced social contacts). Secondly, long-term undernourishment can be held responsible for numerous psychological distortions, including anxiety and depression symptoms such as insomnia, impaired concentration, or social isolation. Thirdly, the natural course of AN can also lead to “depressive moments”, in particular when switching to a “purging type” AN, or when recovery mobilizes control and narcissistic issues. On the other hand, MDD is also highly prevalent among AN patients and is a negative prognosis factor. Thus, it is complex to differentiate MDD from isolated depressive symptoms that could be inherent of the AN symptomatology which raises the question of the role of antidepressant medication in treatment of depression in AN. No significant benefit of antidepressant medication in AN has been shown in clinical trials, and according to international guidelines it should be prescribed only as a second-line treatment, after appropriate refeeding, and in case of an authentic depressive disorder. Those data appear to be in contradiction with the frequent use of those drugs in clinical practice. Discussion Nevertheless, clinical trials assessing antidepressant treatment in AN suffer from methodological weakness concerning the size of the sample, the choice of the population or the evaluation criterion. This lack of proof must raise our vigilance concerning antidepressant medication in AN but should not categorically prevent the clinician from using it when necessary. We do believe that there are some indications for prescribing antidepressant in patients with AN. The clinical challenge lies in the differentiation of the depressive symptoms that are transitory and likely to improve without medication from those that signal the presence of an MDD. Three criterion could be indicative of MDD: familial history of mood disorder, as it is a major risk factor for MDD among relatives; the chronology of appearance of both disorders, when MDD pre-exists AN; a few specific symptoms cannot be attributed to undernourishment or reactive depressive signs, such as morning insomnia, daily variation of depressive symptoms, suicidal attempts or ideation and guilt ideation. Thus, in integrating the data from the literature review, we propose a pragmatic therapeutic strategy for the use of an antidepressant in AN during adolescence that lies in 3 main categories for depressive manifestations in AN: therapeutic emergencies: when an obvious and severe MDD is comorbid to AN, immediate antidepressant would be required; isolated and non-specific depressive sign: no medication would be relevant as they are supposed to improve with refeeding and psychotherapeutic support; intermediary patterns which is probably the most frequent situation. In the last case, it would be relevant to abstain from prescribing medication in first line, but an antidepressant medication should be quickly considered in the presence of one (or several) criterion listed above and its persistence despite refeeding. The general medical state of this fragile population of patients should be evaluated (standard blood test, ECG) before and during treatment. © 2016 L'Encéphale, Paris","Anorexia nervosa; Antidepressive agents; Depression; Diagnosis; Therapeutics","antidepressant agent; antidepressant agent; anorexia nervosa; Article; clinical trial (topic); depression; human; insomnia; major depression; malnutrition; Medline; risk factor; self esteem; social isolation; suicide attempt; systematic review; anorexia nervosa; Anxiety Disorders; comorbidity; complication; depression; Depressive Disorder, Major; psychology; Anorexia Nervosa; Antidepressive Agents; Anxiety Disorders; Comorbidity; Depression; Depressive Disorder, Major; Humans; Suicide, Attempted",2-s2.0-85002623775

An important one is that its throughput can be severely degraded when an overload happens in the proxy server because of several retransmissions from the user agent. One common approach to overcome this problem is ‘load balancing’. A balancer needs to know the status of proxy servers, which are continuously gathered implicitly or explicitly. Implicit methods have averagely less overhead than explicit ones. This paper attempts to prevent throughput reduction by balancing the loads among available proxy servers properly using an implicit mechanism called History Weighted Average Response time. The proposed algorithm is robust because it incurs no extra processing to proxy servers. The novelty of the mechanism is making use of ‘response time history’ to estimate the load being currently processed on servers. By implementing in a real testbed, throughput and scalability are improved compared with an important state-of-the-art similar algorithm. This improvement stems from no need for modification in SIP protocol, easy implementation and application, simple computations for making decision and no need for extra feedback between servers and load balancer.

The aim of this study was to determine which of three different interventions would assist student performance in a nursing bioscience unit. Method To begin, the contribution of recent prior learning in science was investigated by comparing the final exam marks of 182 students in the bioscience unit with the science marks they achieved at high (secondary) school. The effect of recent prior learning was then tested by investigating whether the first intervention, a pre-nursing bioscience workshop of 63 students, would substitute for recent high school science. Two further interventions were tested that used a stronger student-focused contribution to the teaching and learning within the bioscience unit. These were the Human Body Club which was composed of 44 under-performing students and an online learning platform known as LearnSmart that was used by a cohort of 263 students. Results and discussion Good and recent high school attainment in the sciences did improve student performance, whilst recent prior learning in the form of a bioscience workshop did not. Both student-focused interventions improved student performance. The longer a student spent using LearnSmart the more their mark increased.

This analysis reveals many of the aspects that were generically shared by the psychological agenda of the period when analyzing aesthetic experience and activity. Outstanding among these are the relationship of the musical phenomenon with very basic or primary affective-emotional dimensions, the conception of the musical phenomenon as an indicator of the cognitive-affective development of human groups, its expression in the form of cultural and complex intersubjective products, or its possible participation in the technoscientific design of social reform and progress. The simultaneous treatment of all of these aspects in Odum's work brings to light the interdisciplinary framework in which early psychology moved, while revealing the theoretical and ideological contradictions and controversies that enveloped the discipline, above all, at the point where it attempted to place itself at the service of the constitution of self-governed individuals.

This study investigates two different approaches to predict these quantities using regression models in combination with a multitude of noninvasively accessible, explanatory variables. We have gathered a large dataset comprising tensile tests performed with AAA specimens and supplementary patient information based on blood analysis, the patients medical history, and geometric features of the AAAs. Using this unique database, we harness the capability of state-of-the-art Bayesian regression techniques to infer probabilistic models for multiple quantities of interest. After a brief presentation of our experimental results, we show that we can effectively reduce the predictive uncertainty in the assessment of several patient-specific parameters, most importantly in thickness and failure strength of the AAA wall. Thereby, the more elaborate Bayesian regression approach based on Gaussian processes consistently outperforms standard linear regression. Moreover, our study contains a comparison to a previously proposed model for the wall strength. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Abdominal aortic aneurysm; Bayesian regression; Wall properties","Blood vessels; Risk assessment; Statistical tests; Tensile testing; Abdominal aortic aneurysms; Bayesian regression; Constitutive properties; Multiple quantities of interest; Non-invasive prediction; Patient specific parameters; Predictive uncertainty; Wall properties; Regression analysis; abdominal aorta aneurysm; adult; aged; aorta wall; arterial wall thickness; Article; Bayes theorem; biomechanics; blood analysis; data base; explanatory variable; human; human tissue; major clinical study; medical history; non invasive procedure; normal distribution; patient information; prediction; priority journal; probability; regression analysis; statistical model; tensile strength; uncertainty",2-s2.0-85011690480

Local analysis in the ensemble Kalman filter has been used extensively for very large models in numerical weather prediction. It scales well with the model size and the number of data and is easily parallelized. In the petroleum literature, however, iterative ensemble smoothers with localization of the Kalman gain matrix have become the state-of-the-art approach for ensemble-based history matching. By forming the Kalman gain matrix row-by-row, the analysis step can also be parallelized. Localization regularizes updates to model parameters and state variables using information on the distance between the these variables and the observations. The truncation of small singular values in truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD) at the analysis step provides another type of regularization by projecting updates to dominant directions spanned by the simulated data ensemble. Typically, the combined use of localization and TSVD is necessary for problems with large amounts of data. In this paper, we compare the performance of Kalman gain localization to two forms of local analysis for parameter estimation problems with nonlocal data. The effect of TSVD with different localization methods and with the use of iteration is also analyzed. With several examples, we show that good results can be obtained for all localization methods if the localization range is chosen appropriately, but the optimal localization range differs for the various methods. In general, for local analysis with observation taper, the optimal range is somewhat shorter than the optimal range for other localization methods. Although all methods gave equivalent results when used in an iterative ensemble smoother, the local analysis methods generally converged more quickly than Kalman gain localization when the amount of data is large compared to ensemble size. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Ensemble Kalman filter; History matching; Iterative ensemble smoother; Local analysis; Localization; Regularization","data assimilation; ensemble forecasting; Kalman filter",2-s2.0-84994291441

Since foreign aid for HIV/AIDS in Vietnam is rapidly decreasing, we sought to assess willingness to pay (WTP) for viral load and CD4 cell count tests among HIV-positive patients, and identified factors that might inform future co-payment schemes. Methods: A multi-site cross-sectional survey was conducted with 1133 HIV-positive patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Hanoi and Nam Dinh. Patients' health insurance coverage, quality of life, and history of illicit drug use were assessed. A contingent valuation approach was employed to measure patients' WTP for CD4 cell count and viral load testing. Results: HIV-positive patients receiving ART at provincial sites reported more difficulty obtaining health insurance (HI) and had the overall the poorest quality of life. Most patients (90.9%) were willing to pay for CD4 cell count testing; here, the mean WTP was valued at US$8.2 (95%CI = 7.6±8.8 US$) per test. Most patients (87.3%) were also willing to pay for viral load testing; here, mean WTP was valued at US$18.6 (95%CI = 16.3±20.9 US$) per test. High income, high education level, and hospitalization were positively associated with WTP, while co-morbidity with psychiatric symptoms and trouble paying for health insurance were both negatively related to WTP. Conclusions: These findings raise concerns that HIV-positive patients in Vietnam might have low WTP for CD4 cell count and viral load testing. This means that without foreign financial subsidies, many of these patients would likely go without these important tests. Treating psychiatric co-morbidities, promoting healthcare services utilization, and removing barriers to accessing health insurance may increase WTP for monitoring of HIV/AIDS treatment among HIV +-positive Vietnamese patients. © 2017 Nguyen et al.

In this article we will first examine the posthuman in relation to the macro-historical framework of the Anthropocene. Adopting key notions from complexity theory, we argue that the earlier counter-figures of environmental catastrophe (Anthropocene entropy) and corporeal enhancement (transhuman negentropy) should be juxtaposed and blended. Furthermore, we argue for the relevance of a comprehensive aesthetical perspective in a discussion of posthuman challenges. Whereas popular visual culture and many novels illustrate posthuman dilemmas (e.g. the superhero's oscillation between superhuman and human) in a respect for humanist naturalist norms, avant-garde art performs a posthuman alienation of the earlier negentropic centres of art, a problematization of the human body and mind, that is structurally equivalent to the environmental modification of negentropic rise taking place in the Anthropocene. In a spatial sprawl from immaterial information to material immersion, the autonomous human body and mind, the double apex of organic negentropy, are thus undermined through a dialectics of entropy and order, from abstraction's indeterminacy to Surrealism's fragmentation of the body and its interlacing with inorganic things. © Academia Europaea 2016.",,"Anthropocene; complexity; esthetics; social history; social theory",2-s2.0-84989831612

In HIV, inflammation is also increased within lymph nodes (LNs), tissues known to harbor the virus even among treated and suppressed individuals. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that arterial inflammation is linked to HIV disease activity and to inflammation within HIV-infected tissues (LNs). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: For this case-control study, participants were recruited from the SCOPE (Observational Study of the Consequences of the Protease Inhibitor Era) cohort, a clinic-based cohort of individuals receiving care at San Francisco General Hospital and the San Francisco Veteran’s Affairs Medical Center. Arterial and LN inflammation were measured using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. Detailed immunophenotyping was performed, along with measurement of viral activity/persistence and of circulating inflammatory biomarkers. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Arterial and LN inflammation. RESULTS: A total of 74 men were studied (45 HIV-infected men with a median age of 53 years [interquartile range, 49-59 years] and 29 uninfected male controls with a median age of 52 years [interquartile range, 46-56 years]). Lymph node inflammation was higher in HIV-infected individuals and correlated with markers of viral disease activity (viral load, CD8+ T cells, and CD4/CD8 ratio) and CD4+ T-cell activation. Uninfected controls had the lowest LN activity (mean [SD] maximum axillary LN standardized uptake value, 1.53 [0.56]), the elite controller and ART-suppressed groups had intermediate levels of LN (mean [SD] maximum axillary LN standardized uptake value, 2.12 [0.87] and 2.32 [1.79], respectively), and the noncontrollers had the highest activity (mean [SD] maximum axillary LN standardized uptake value, 8.82 [3.08]). Arterial inflammation was modestly increased in HIV-infected individuals and was positively correlated with circulating inflammatory biomarkers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and IL-6) and activated monocytes (CD14dimCD16+; nonclassical) but not with markers of HIV. While LN and arterial inflammation were increased in HIV, inflammatory activity in these tissues was not related (r = 0.09, P = .56). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: While LNs and, to a lesser degree, the arterial wall are inflamed in HIV, inflammation in these tissues is not closely linked. Namely, measures of HIV disease activity are strongly associated with LN inflammation but not with arterial inflammation. These data suggest that LN and arterial inflammation do not share underlying pathways of immune activation and also that therapeutic interventions that reduce viral disease activity may not predictably reduce arterial inflammation in HIV or its downstream consequence (ie, cardiovascular disease).

The present article provides a history of this idea through a close analysis of its primary theorist and most visible spokesperson, Dr. Billy Taylor. It argues that the idea was not a neoclassical and conservative product of the 1980s, but had important roots in the Black Arts imperatives of the later 1960s and early 1970s. It suggests that Taylor initially made the idea work inventively and productively in a variety of contexts, especially through his community arts project Jazzmobile, but that these contexts diverged as his public profile was stretched thin across and beyond the United States. The idea's disintegration into clichéd ubiquity in the mid-1980s then provides a critical perspective on the idea of the ""jazz renaissance,"" and an opportunity to consider the role of the jazz ambassador in the context of debates about African American intellectuals. © Cambridge University Press and British Association for American Studies 2016.",,,2-s2.0-85028270413

Three findings follow. First, claims about the end of privacy point to an unusually broad range of technological and institutional causes. Privacy has been pronounced defunct for decades, but there has never been a near consensus about its causes. Second, unlike other endist talk (the end of art or history, etc.), privacy endism appears ongoing and not period specific. Finally, our explanation of the persistence and idiosyncrasy of claims to the end of privacy focuses on Warren and Brandeis’s 1890 negative conception of privacy as ‘the right to be let alone’: namely, modern privacy talk has always been endist because the right to privacy was born out of the conditions for its violation, not its realization.

They serve as an excellent resource for understanding the historical context of teaching drawing. As the industrial revolution geared forward in the nineteenth century, drawing books became a crucial source for sharing and disseminating educational philosophies for the teaching of drawing as well as understanding artistic practices. Serving many informal and traditional educational contexts, drawing books can be seen as evidence of how people learned or were taught. Although many accounts of teaching of drawing are known, little is documented about the many drawing manuals developed by art educators in England and its colonies, specifically India. This article examines nineteenth-century drawing books by George Wallis (1811–91) and Ernest Beinfeld Havell (1861–1934) and the subsequent influence of these books on art education in England and India. Through comparison between the different approaches of authoring these drawing books, one could argue that both Havell and Wallis pursued nationalistic and personal goals by juxtaposing the authoring styles of their books. It was evident that George Wallis’ authorship of his drawing books was grounded in his philosophy of education, appreciation for design education, and dedication to England. Havell's drawing books, on the other hand, attempted to provide students with the knowledge of Indian sculpture, architecture and painting thereby exposing them to India's artistic heritage as well as raising awareness about utilising Indian art as the basis of instruction at the Indian art schools as part of the larger Indian nationalist movement against British rule. Their histories cumulatively bring to print a specific account of drawing manuals used during the nineteenth century and their influence on the teaching and learning of drawing in England and India. © 2016 The Author. iJADE © 2016 NSEAD/John Wiley & Sons Ltd","colonialism; drawing books; E.

Stochastic stability is essential when sampling from these models, as done in computational neuroscience to analyze statistical properties of neuronal dynamics and in neuro-engineering to implement closed-loop applications. Here we show, however, that despite passing common goodness-of-fit tests, PP-GLMs estimated from data are often unstable, leading to divergent firing rates. The inclusion of absolute refractory periods is not a satisfactory solution since the activity then typically settles into unphysiological rates. To address these issues, we derive a framework for determining the existence and stability of fixed points of the expected conditional intensity function (CIF) for general PP-GLMs. Specifically, in nonlinear Hawkes PP-GLMs, the CIF is expressed as a function of the previous spike history and exogenous inputs. We use a mean-field quasi-renewal (QR) approximation that decomposes spike history effects into the contribution of the last spike and an average of the CIF over all spike histories prior to the last spike. Fixed points for stationary rates are derived as self-consistent solutions of integral equations. Bifurcation analysis and the number of fixed points predict that the original models can show stable, divergent, and metastable (fragile) dynamics. For fragile models, fluctuations of the single-neuron dynamics predict expected divergence times after which rates approach unphysiologically high values. This metric can be used to estimate the probability of rates to remain physiological for given time periods, e.g., for simulation purposes. We demonstrate the use of the stability framework using simulated single-neuron examples and neurophysiological recordings. Finally, we show how to adapt PP-GLM estimation procedures to guarantee model stability. Overall, our results provide a stability framework for data-driven PP-GLMs and shed new light on the stochastic dynamics of state-of-the-art statistical models of neuronal spiking activity. © 2017 Public Library of Science.

We assessed the relationship between immunologic and vascular parameters in 70 HIV-infected adults on efavirenz, tenofovir, and emtricitabine with more than 2 years of virologic suppression and no history of CVD. We measured brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) using ultrasound and circulating intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) by multiple immunoassay. We also measured circulating naive (CD45RO-CCR7+CD27+), activated (CD38+ and CD38+DR+), exhausted (PD1+), senescent (CD57+), and memory (CD45RO+) CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets by flow cytometry, and macrophage activation markers by ELISA and multiple immunoassay. Regression models were adjusted for age, sex, smoking, duration of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and body mass index. Median age was 45 years (IQR 39, 50), median CD4+ count 701 cells/μl (IQR 540, 954), and 43% were female. Lower brachial FMD was associated with a higher percentage of activated CD8+ T cells (p &lt; .01), but not associated with macrophage activation. In contrast, higher ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were associated with sCD163 (p &lt; = .01 for both), macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (p &lt; = .02 for both), and sCD14 (p = .01 for ICAM-1 only). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that circulating CD8+ T cell activation may impair arterial smooth muscle relaxation, while macrophage activation has a role in the expression of endothelial cell proteins involved in immune cell translocation. Both innate and cellular immune activation appear to promote arterial vascular disease in HIV-infected persons on ART using differing mechanisms. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.","Cardiovascular; Endothelium; Flow-mediated dilation; HIV; Immune activation","CD163 antigen; CD27 antigen; CD38 antigen; CD38 DR antigen; CD4 antigen; CD45RO antigen; CD57 antigen; CD8 antigen; chemokine receptor CCR7; efavirenz; emtricitabine; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha; tenofovir; unclassified drug; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; adult; antiretroviral therapy; arterial smooth muscle; artery disease; Article; atherosclerosis; body mass; brachial artery; cardiovascular disease; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cellular immunity; echography; endothelial dysfunction; endothelium cell; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; flow cytometry; flow-mediated dilation test; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; immunoassay; immunocompetent cell; innate immunity; macrophage activation; major clinical study; male; memory T lymphocyte; middle aged; priority journal; smoking; smooth muscle relaxation; T lymphocyte; T lymphocyte activation; T lymphocyte subpopulation; treatment duration; vascular smooth muscle",2-s2.0-85012048726

Assembled from such things as matchboxes, washing powder packets, old medicine packaging, split-open coffee pots, lacquered paper, and wire, Glöckner’s constructions resemble maquettes for large-scale sculptures never to be realized. Their appearance suggests a hybrid aesthetic, a kind of Cold War meeting between the Soviet constructivist relief models of Vladimir Tatlin or the experiments of Aleksandr Rodchenko and the appropriated consumerist detritus of American pop art (less the smooth serialized screen prints of Andy Warhol than the assemblages of Robert Rauschenberg or Edward Kienholz).

It examines Glöckner’s practice alongside the mass utopias of both consumerism and communism, considering these objects in the context of the history of Soviet constructivism and the nonofficial practices to emerge later in the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. © 2017 by New German Critique, Inc.","Abstraction; Avant-garde; German democratic republic; Hermann Glöckner; Utopia",,2-s2.0-85014966749

The afferent visual system including the retina is part of the central nervous system. Many neurological diseases can cause loss of visual function, which is an important determinant of loss of quality of life in affected patients. This has led to an increasing application of state-of-the-art diagnostic methods for investigating the afferent visual system in clinical neurology and neurological research. Low-contrast visual acuity tests and color vision tests can complement classic high-contrast visual testing. Multifocal visual evoked potentials allow assessment of axonal strands. Optical coherence tomography enables high-resolution imaging of the retina and intra-retinal layers. In clinical research, diffusion weighted imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging can be used for microstructural and functional assessment of neuronal structures and white matter. Structured questionnaires are available to screen for visual function loss. A detailed assessment of the afferent visual system is increasingly part of neurological examinations not only in autoimmune neuroinflammatory disorders like multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, MOG-IgG associated encephalomyelitis or Susac syndrome, but also in Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. This review outlines relevant methods for structural and functional assessment of the afferent visual system and summarizes showcases for application of these methods in neurological diseases. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.","diffusion tensor imaging; optical coherence tomography; visual dysfunction; visual evoked potentials; visual system","clinical research; functional assessment; human; neurologic disease; neurology; Review; sensory nerve; visual system",2-s2.0-85014734167

This wealth of artefacts and monuments testifies to human history, cosmology and identity. While cultural sites are especially important to local and Indigenous communities, a stall in coordinated global action means adaptation at a local scale is often unsupported. In response, this paper produces a practical climate change risk analysis methodology designed for independent, community-scale management of cultural sites. It builds on existing methods that prioritise sites most at risk from climate impacts, proposing a field survey that integrates an assessment of the relative cultural value of sites with assessment of exposure and sensitivity to climate impacts. The field survey also stands as a monitoring program and complements an assessment of organisational adaptive capacity. The preliminary field survey was tested by Indigenous land managers in remote northern Australia at midden and rock art sites threatened by sea level rise, extreme flood events and a range of non-climactic hazards. A participatory action research methodology—incorporating planning workshops, semi-structured interviews and participant observations—gave rise to significant modifications to the preliminary field survey as well as management prioritisation of 120 sites. The field survey is anticipated to have global application, particularly among marginalised and remote Indigenous communities. Well-planned and informed participation, with community control, monitoring and well-informed actions, will contribute significantly to coordinated global and regional adaptation strategies. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Adaptation; Archaeology; Climate change; Community planning; Cultural heritage; Indigenous; Local planning; Risk assessment; Site prioritisation; Vulnerability assessment",,2-s2.0-85011298731

With coarse-scale DA, the unknown property function associated with each ensemble member is upscaled to a grid significantly coarser than the original reservoir simulator grid. The grid coarsening is automatic, ensemble-specific and non-uniform. The selection of regions where the grid can be coarsened without introducing too large modelling errors is performed using a second-generation wavelet transform allowing for seamless handling of non-dyadic grids and inactive grid cells. An inexpensive local-local upscaling is performed on each ensemble member. A DA algorithm that restarts from initial time is utilized, which avoids the need for downscaling. Since the DA computational cost roughly equals the number of ensemble members times the cost of a single forward simulation, coarse-scale DA allows for a significant increase in the number of ensemble members at the same computational cost as standard DA with localization. Fixing the computational cost for both approaches, the quality of coarse-scale DA is compared to that of standard DA with localization (using state-of-the-art localization techniques) on examples spanning a large degree of variability. It is found that coarse-scale DA is more robust with respect to variation in example type than each of the localization techniques considered with standard DA. Although the paper is concerned with two spatial dimensions, coarse-scale DA is easily extendible to three spatial dimensions, where it is expected that its advantage with respect to standard DA with localization will increase. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Coarse-scale data assimilation; Localization; Second-generation wavelets; Upscaling","algorithm; data assimilation; downscaling; ensemble forecasting; hydrocarbon exploration; hydrocarbon reservoir; wavelet analysis",2-s2.0-84995403935

This medicinal herb has a long folklore history of its usage in the treatment of several health disorders owing to the presence of a variety of secondary metabolites, particularly the alkaloids, phenolics and anthocyanins. Among its various bioactive molecules, C. roseus is most valued for being the exclusive bio-resource of two of the most effective anti-cancerous drugs—vincristine and vinblastine that are indispensible components of several modern day chemotherapeutic regimens. The in-planta yields of these bioactive TIAs are extremely low (<0.0002 %) owing to very rigid developmental, genetical and environmental regulation controls as a part of plant’s own auto-protection strategies against these cytotoxic molecules. Consequently the high cost of production coupled with increasing market demand for these alkaloidal drugs have made TIAs pathway as one of the preferred target for plant metabolic engineering efforts to boost their commercial production. The transgenic approaches so far applied in C. roseus can be grouped into three major lines of investigations. The first line of efforts have been dominated by the genetic transformation studies carried out with wild type Ti or Ri plasmids to measure the influence of their random insertion on TIAs biogenesis. These studies, besides helping the optimization of basic transformation protocols at different levels of cellular differentiation, have largely contributed towards the better resolution and expression of TIAs pathway architecture at the level of associated genes and enzymes. Second line of metabolic engineering works is being centered around the efforts on preparation of genomic libraries and genome mapping to hunt for TIAs pathway genes and associated transcription regulators/factors, followed by their cloning, insertion and hyper-expression to modulate the carbon flux towards desired end products. Modern day transgenic attempts in C. roseus are largely focused on superimposing the concurrent influences of biotic and abiotic elicitation, T-DNA activation and RNAi or virus induced gene silencing approaches for higher TIAs biogenesis. The pace of transgenic research in C. roseus in last two decade has been rapid and demands periodic compilation and reviewing of published literature to provide a handy status up-date of the subject. The present compilation is an effort in this direction and intends to provide a state-of-art account of various transgenic approaches currently being pursued in this high value herb. More than 130 research papers have appeared on various aspects of transgenic cells, tissues and plant production in C. roseus in 30 years. The bulk of these efforts (64.96 %) were made at the level of Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated hairy root cultures, followed by 26.80 % in A. tumefaciens-mediated transformed tissues and 8.24 % in cells/tissue cultures subjected to particle bombardment approach. In the present compilation, these studies are further grouped into specific categories wherein over-expression of TIAs pathway specific genes, transcriptional factor regulation, elicitation/stress superimposition, transgenic plant regeneration, metabolites profiling and gene silencing etc. were investigated in different transformed tissue. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Agrobacterium rhizogenes; Agrobacterium tumefaciens; Catharanthus roseus; Particle bombardment; Post translational gene silencing; Terpenoid indole alkaloids; Transcription factors; Transgenics","ajmalicine; alkaloid derivative; catharanthine; indole derivative; terpenoid; verapamil; vinblastine; vincristine; Agrobacterium tumefaciens; antineoplastic activity; bacterial strain; bioaccumulation; biosynthesis; Catharanthus roseus; gene activation; genetic engineering; genetic transformation; hairy root culture; human; nonhuman; phytochemistry; plant genetics; plant genome; plant parameters; plant structures; posttranscriptional gene silencing; Review; Rhizobium rhizogenes; signal transduction; transgenics",2-s2.0-84946141920

Workshops expanded over time and are now taught by highly experienced pediatric clinicians across the globe. In 1987, a small vanguard of North American faculty, academic pediatricians, and pediatric psychologists taught a 3-day pediatric hypnosis workshop at the national meeting of the Society for Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics (SDBP). This model of annual tri-level concurrent workshops (introductory, intermediate, and advanced) was sponsored by the SDBP for 24 years. In 2009, the National Pediatric Hypnosis Training Institute (NPHTI) assembled, and in 2010, offered its first annual workshops. This article documents this history of pediatric hypnosis education and describes NPHTI’s remodeling and ongoing refinement toward a state-of-the-art curriculum with innovative methodology based upon (1) current research about adult experiential and small group learning; (2) design principles for presentations that maximize adult learning and memory; and (3) evaluations by participants and faculty. These underpinnings—including clinical training videos, individualized learning choices, emphasis on personalized, goal-oriented sessions, and advances in faculty selection, and ongoing development—are applicable to adult training models. Integration of developmental and self-regulation strategies may be more unique to pediatric hypnosis skills training programs. The conclusion proposes expansion of pediatric hypnosis education and elimination of related barriers toward goals that all children learn self-hypnosis (SH) for mind–body health.

Every day millions of professionals use a countless number of technical words to refer to the different structures inside the skull. But few of them would know how to explain their origin. In this study we take an in-depth look into the etymological origins of some of these neuroanatomical terms. Development. The study takes an etymological tour of the central nervous system. It is in no way meant to be an exhaustive, detailed review of the terms currently in use, but instead a means to familiarise the reader with the linguistic past of words like brain, hippocampus, thalamus, claustrum, fornix, corpus callosum or limbic system. All of them come from either Greek or Latin, which were used for centuries as the lingua francas of science. The study also analyses the evolution of the word meninges, originally of Greco-Latin origin, although its current usages derive from Arabic. Conclusions. The neuroanatomical terms that are in use today do not come from words that associate a particular brain structure with its function, but instead from words that reflect the formal or conceptual similarity between a structure and a familiar or everyday entity (for example, an object or a part of the human body). In other cases, these words indicate the spatial location of the neuroanatomical structure with respect to a third, or they may be terms derived from characters in Greco-Latin mythology. © 2017 Revista de Neurología.","Brain; Etymology; History; Mythology; Neuroanatomy; Skull","art; brain fornix; claustrum; corpus callosum; hippocampus; human; limbic system; literature; meninx; neuroanatomy; skull; structure activity relation; thalamus; tongue",2-s2.0-85032513231

The first was a teleological narrative that focused on the series of anti-formalist insurgencies that ended with the rise of modernist art and architecture. The second, a cultural hegemony approach, portrayed arts patronage, philanthropy, and museums as promoting cultural hierarchies that validated the status and authority of the industrial bourgeoisie. In recent decades, the postmodern assault on received narratives, an invigorated cultural and intellectual history, the historic preservation movement, and gender and transnational analysis have combined to erode these frameworks. This chapter argues for a broad understanding of art's role in society.

The main challenge in pattern spotting is that the query image is generally small and the occurrences may be located at any random places in the image. Rather than exhaustively indexing all possible subwindows extracted from the document images, the common way is to rely on a segmentation or a document layout analysis to limit the search space. However, there is no segmentation nor document layout analysis technique reliable enough for historical document images. Region proposal, a technique used to generate a set of regions potentially containing an object, has contributed to many state of the art object detection systems recently. Although it is initially proposed for object detection, we will show that region proposal also offers promising results for document images, particularly in the case of pattern spotting. In this paper, we aim at investigating the use of region proposal to produce high quality subwindows to replace the usual document layout analysis step and the blind sliding windowing step. From experiments conducted on the DocExplore dataset, we show that region proposal generates a comparable number of subwindows while helping the system to achieve significant better results than the system built with commonly used layout analysis techniques. © 2016 IEEE.","Historical document image retrieval; Pattern spotting; Region proposal","Character recognition; History; Image analysis; Image retrieval; Image segmentation; Object recognition; Quality control; Document images; Document layout analysis; Graphical objects; Historical documents; Object detection systems; Pattern spotting; Region proposal; State of the art; Object detection",2-s2.0-85012909420

Surgery includes numerous different procedures. Of those, vaginoplasty is predominant and aims at providing attractive esthetics and fully functional genitals. This study aimed to present the surgical results of our modified combined vaginoplasty technique in a consecutive patient cohort. Methods: We included 40 MTF transgender patients who underwent a two-stage sex reassignment surgery (SRS) in an observational prospective study between September 2012 and January 2014. Demographic characteristics, medical and surgical history, operative details, and outcomes after surgery were documented. Postoperatively, 23 patients received a pelvic examination following the standardized protocol. Results: Measured vaginal depth was 11.77-14.99 cm depending on the size of the dilator used (25-40 mm). Vaginal, clitoral, and labial sensitivities were intact and favorable in all examined patients. Nineteen women (47.5%) opted for breast augmentations to achieve a feminine cosmesis, making it the most common nongenital operation. Complications were mostly minor and temporary. Severe adverse events, such as wound infections (n = 3), colon injuries (3), short (1) or narrow (1) vaginas, or partial clitoral necroses (1), were rare and immediately addressed by the surgical team. No vaginal construction was lost, and no secondary reconstructive approaches were required. Conclusion: Satisfactory physical results and favorable low rates of complications endorse our combined technique for MTF SRS. These findings, however, need to be confirmed by other research groups as well. Therefore, in our opinion, MTF SRS remains an evolving area of development, whose research is aiming to establish a state-of-the-art surgical technique. © 2017 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.","Combined technique; Gender dysphoria; Male-to-female; Outcomes; Sex reassignment surgery; Vaginoplasty","adult; adverse effects; classification; cohort analysis; demography; esthetics; female; human; male; outcome assessment; Postoperative Complications; procedures; prospective study; reconstructive surgery; sex reassignment; surgery; vagina; Adult; Cohort Studies; Demography; Esthetics; Female; Humans; Male; Patient Outcome Assessment; Postoperative Complications; Prospective Studies; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Sex Reassignment Surgery; Vagina",2-s2.0-85020891825

Studying the practices of highly regarded teachers is valuable for identifying promising practices and stubborn obstacles to reform. We found that although these highly regarded teachers allocated 3 times more class time to working with text than to teacher lecture and explanation, opportunities to engage in text-based argumentation with multiple sources were rare. Furthermore, less than a 3rd of the time allocated to working with text engaged students in actively making meaning from text. When literacy tasks did occur, they were associated with a disciplinary knowledge focus, challenging the notion that literacy activity occurs at the expense of content instruction. Close reading and cross-textual analysis frequently co-occurred with each other and with argumentation, which suggests that intervention designs should foreground these building blocks of argumentation. Disciplinary differences in opportunity to learn indicate that norms of instruction may carry greater weight than disciplinary norms of reasoning and discourse, which suggests that a particular focus on transforming literacy instruction in science may be warranted.

Vigil, Atlántida magazine kept a well-defined interest in images. The covers, a clear example in that sense, displayed colourful works on full pages while the content itself reflected that through cartoons, graphic sections, vignettes, illustrations and photographs. Conceived as a mass-market project, Atlántida worked with images and texts resorting to the popular and the cultured within the magazine’s layout. Thus, they implemented innovative strategies in the promotion of art, combining a humorous register with texts and images within institutional circuits. This essay is aimed at analysing that peculiar device articulating professional art reviews and reproductions of academic paintings linked also to the art market, with humorous illustrations and textual interventions which spoofed the artistic system. In this vein, the role played by cartoons will be studied, together with the criteria for choosing cover images and the introduction of professional criticism, to eventually focus on an emblematic case in Argentinean art history: Emilio Pettoruti’s exhibition of 1924 and its counterpart, the Salón Ultrafuturista [Ultrafuturistic Salon], a satire of avant-garde proposals and, in short, a questioning of the progress of modern art through humorous means. Our intention is then to reflect upon the artistic promotion strategies which had an impact on the development of consumption, and among which humour turned out to be a critical component. The magazine will be thus conceived as a device for the circulation of imaginaries moulding the sensitivity of the time and the readers’ artistic understanding. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Argentina; Atlántida magazine; cultural consumption; fine arts; humour",,2-s2.0-85013224916

I propose to focus particularly in some examples of his paintings from the 1970s when Batarda developed a watercolour technique of saturated colours and refined drawing to make an explicit cumulative figuration akin to underground comics. He used it not only to comment the changing in the art world but in the world itself, namely the political changes in Portugal and the colonial war, as well as foreign policies, mixing all up in layers of multiple readings, and intrinsically connecting art history and politics. The fact that he used comics to do it was a way of mocking the art world with a language that was considered “low”. He also used the watercolour technique consciously for its conventional relegation to a less prestigious realm, and both this technique along with the painstaking quality of execution, with highly complex drawing and painting skills, contrasted to an at times explicitly pornographic thematic. There is in these options a constant and deliberate contradiction in terms as a way to show the absurdity of conventions. The paintings from this period have been described by the painter as “permanent commentaries on the state of the arts”. This paper will analyse the way these commentaries used comics as a tool for criticism from within the medium of painting. © 2016 Konsthistoriska Sallskapet.",,,2-s2.0-84991030084

Even though the most influential discourse about ink art in Hong Kong has clearly been produced by official institutions, like the future museum of visual culture called M+ and the already existing Museum of Art, it has also been profoundly influenced by private associations whose influence has been far reaching. The most visible of these private associations in Hong Kong is the Ink Society, whose founding members and their affiliates and friends have played a central role in the early debate about the nature of ink art in the history of local arts. Through an analysis of a failed attempt by the Ink Society to bid for the right to manage a historical site, this paper attempts to unravel some of the ideas that support the notion of ink art in Hong Kong. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","art collector; Chinese painting; Hong Kong; ink art; museum",,2-s2.0-85012266362

Artists working within this turn often employ critical-aesthetic strategies to records in order to reconsider historical narratives, expose missing or silenced voices, interrogate modes of representation, or investigate relations between official and personal memory through art-making processes and works. Other artists combine these strategies with socially and community-engaged practices, as did poet Kaia Sand and interdisciplinary artist Garrick Imatani, who were artists-in-residence at the City of Portland Archives and Records Center in Portland, Oregon from 2013 to 2015.

In particular, the debt to artistic practices and practitioners of the forms of surgery pioneered during WWI (with particular reference to facial reconstructive surgery). (2) The cultural legacy of les gueules cassées in the longue durée. The enduring influence of facial injury upon our experience, perception, and representations of disfigurement.

The insights of Art History are drawn upon to expose this ‘dark side’ of past urban and regional development. This is because just as art thrives in propitious economic conditions, so it also declines when the money runs out. Certain unpleasant events can be traced to the exhaustion of Utopian practice, Enlightenment ideals and a weakness of states. This led to a fascination with the apparent decay of long-established values formerly expressed in western culture that now share more nihilistic elements with contemporary eastern culture.

This article will examine Gowers’ own use of eponyms alongside the eponymous medical terms named for him, and, in the process, will show how Gowers’ “inconvenience” may be of great service to the historically inclined modern clinician today. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","A Manual of Diseases of the Nervous System; Gowers eponyms; Gowers’ sign; Gowers’ tract; medical eponyms; origins of Gowers sign; origins of Gowers’ tract; Sir William Richard Gowers (1845–1915); the Gowers centenary","art; history; human; nervous system; neurologist; neurology; nomenclature; writing; Authorship; Eponyms; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; Humans; Nervous System; Neurologists; Neurology",2-s2.0-84949790179

Wechsler, a world-renowned eye researcher and virologist, passed away unexpectedly on June 12, 2016 at the age of 68. Many scientists came to know Professor Wechsler as a gifted researcher in the field of ocular Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV-1) latency, reactivation, and pathogenesis. Professor Wechsler published over 150 peer-reviewed scientific papers during his career, pushing forward the frontiers of his field eye research. His colleagues would say, ‘Steve literally wrote the book on herpes latency and reactivation.’ He was the first to show that the HSV-1 latency-associated transcript (LAT) is essential for the HSV-1 high spontaneous reactivation phenotype and that LAT has anti-apoptosis activity. This discovery of LAT’s anti-apoptosis activity, which is a key factor in how the LAT gene enhances reactivation, was published in Science in 2000 and created a new paradigm that greatly increased understanding of HSV-1 latency and reactivation. In collaboration with Professor Lbachir BenMohamed, an immunologist, they later demonstrated that LAT also acts as an immune evasion gene. He was a caring scientist who truly enjoyed working and sharing his experience and expertise with young researchers. He will be remembered as a significant pillar within scientific and ocular herpes research communities worldwide. Professor Wechsler’s dedication to science, his compassionate character, and wonderful sense of humor were exemplary. We, who were his friends and colleagues, will mourn his passing deeply. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,"microRNA; virus RNA; apoptosis; Article; CD8+ T lymphocyte; herpes simplex; Herpes simplex virus 1; human; immune evasion; immunologist; latent period; male; nonhuman; priority journal; scientist; trigeminus ganglion; ultraviolet B radiation; virus gene; virus pathogenesis; virus reactivation; art; history; ophthalmology; United States; virology; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Ophthalmology; United States; Virology",2-s2.0-85001036865

Flournoy employed a broad definition of personification — the representation of stimuli as concrete and specific individuals or inanimate objects. This definition encompassed a more extensive set of phenomena than the definition used by researchers today and was illustrated by cases that would fall outside of contemporary subtypes of synesthetic personification.

The archipelago juts into the Indian Ocean just north of the Tropic of Capricorn. When people started inscribing this rugged granophyre landscape it was an inland range more than 100 km from the coast. Murujuga rock art is contextualized by a 47,000-year-old occupation sequence from the Pilbara, a model for stylistic change, and a predictive model that envisages how people may have adapted to this eventual seascape. Initial testing of an outer island suggests that highly mobile coastal foragers took advantage of interior ranges across the Abydos Plain as sea levels rose after the Last Glacial Maximum. This article describes for the first time evidence for Australia's earliest domestic stone structures (dated to between 8063 and 7355 cal BP) and tests the predictive model. Rosemary Island is an inscribed landscape that reveals the emergence of an arid island and provides insights into the dynamics of mobile arid hunter-fisher-gatherers in the early Holocene.

This reliance on interdisciplinarity to produce robust scholarship speaks, in part, to the ways we think about children and childhood today, as simultaneously embodied, material, cognitive, intersectional, relational, and developmental. Scholars working and connecting across disciplinary boundaries are also a product of the relatively recent emergence of childhood as an area of scholarly interest and the marginalization of the topic in traditional disciplinary silos. This paper takes a unique approach to addressing the interdisciplinary nature of scholarship on children and childhood in the past.

On the other hand, Hong Kong photographer Dustin Shum’s ‘Themeless Parks’ (2008) presents a series images of public parks in Chinese cities and towns. The two projects propose different readings of the ‘postsocialist’ condition in contemporary China. While the domestic shots curated by Sauvin actively mobilise individual and national identities in private and public spaces, Shum’s compositions of shape, colour and architectural density reveal a highly orchestrated ‘China’ that pre-empts the emergence of an individual identity.

The article first briefly contextualizes and discusses the “bipolar” character of the methodology, then expands on Warburg’s key concepts Pathosformel, Nachleben and Denkraum, and introduces the knowledge montage as a practical and unifying methodological apparatus. It also proposes a theoretical updating of Warburg’s methodology through socio-psychological research on the affective turn. The second half of the article is devoted to working through the methodology by way of an exploration of Family Fun, and aims to present an honest account of the exploratory process, so that others can follow it and make their own assessments. As the methodology refuses closure and stays in motion, it is suggested that it potentially opens for an “activist” art history, providing space for unheard and marginalized voices, and engaging in societal, political and individual change with and through visual, embodied, hybrid and moving expressions. © 2016 Konsthistoriska Sallskapet.",,,2-s2.0-84990208983

It considers the importance of their work for contemporary Jewish identity within the terms of wider conceptual questions that preoccupy contemporary art. These concerns are challenging the perceived structures of power, the “performance” of subjectivity and the questioning of authenticity. A deflationary aesthetic is central to the critique of these structures of thinking fuelled by an interest in the relationship between Jewish subjectivity and popular culture that underpins all of these art works. I argue that popular culture plays a key role as a constituting factor in the production of contemporary Anglophone subjectivity. I use the case studies to develop the argument in the three artists’ specificities and the way they all question the idea of authenticity as a stable source of self-understanding. Suzanne Treister questions history and our relationship with historical events, specifically the Holocaust. She also explores questions of the relationship between structures of power and narratives of history. Debora Kass considers the representation of Jewish women, power and iconicity. Doug Fishbone, a younger artist, takes on self-hate as a transformative tool and as a motif that destabilizes Jewishness as a category, especially in an age of the accelerated post-internet-derived subjectivity. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,,2-s2.0-84991481587

It emerged as an antidote to the fast-paced imperatives of global capitalism that urge the entrepreneurial self to speed up and work harder to achieve and demonstrate desired social status. The entrepreneurial self can be understood in the contexts of neoliberalism and the class- and gender-based histories of time-thrift and rational recreation; the entrepreneurial self uses leisure time purposively in the pursuit of status, avoids idle pursuits and has restricted capacity to experience leisurely social relationships. In this article, it is argued that leisurely social relations can be reclaimed by letting go, even temporarily, of time-thrift and the compulsion to use leisure time purposively. Data drawn from in-depth interviews with repeat visitors at two Australian caravan parks revealed that for the period of their holiday the tourists relax, refuse to be driven by schedules, socialise with other tourists and feel no compulsion to use time purposively. The key reasons the tourists return to the parks each year were for the friendships and the sense of community they experience as part of the holiday. Slow tourism by its very nature rejects time-thrift, however, as the movement is harnessed by global capitalism, slow tourism risks becoming a source of conspicuous consumption. The findings of this study suggest that friendship and community thrive more readily in conditions where the need to achieve and demonstrate social status is discarded along with time-thrift. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","friendship; holidays; rational recreation; slow tourism; sociability; time sense","capitalism; entrepreneur; recreational activity; social status; tourism; tourist behavior; Armeria",2-s2.0-84938651140

Areascovered: Early start of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and intensive management of behavioural risk factors are possible but, at best, marginally successful ways to manage immune activation. We review alternative, possible strategies to reduce immune activation in HIV infection including timing of ART initiation and ART intensification to reduce HIV residual viremia; switch of ART to newer molecules with reduced toxicity; use of anti inflammatory/immunomodulatory agents and, finally, interventions aimed at modifying the composition of the microbiota. Expertcommentary: Current therapeutic strategies to limit immune activation are only marginally successful.

Scholars and practitioners on both sides of the divide often made broad generalizations about the musical and lyrical characteristics of these two repertories, ignoring or downplaying the marked distinctions within the categories. Contemporary worship music (hereafter CWM) can be traced to the late 1960s, one might expect the differences within it to be less pronounced than in the hymn repertory of several hundred years, but important distinctions have emerged over CWM’s more than forty-year history. And while growing attention is being paid to worship song lyrics, musical style remains infrequently addressed.1 This article aims in part to illustrate the point—one that may seem obvious to its practitioners—that CWM is not a stylistically homogenous repertory. Further, the differences within CWM reflect both the changing contexts of its creation and differing concerns and convictions of its songwriters. To highlight some of these crucial differences and explore their meanings and effects, we will take a roughly chronological journey through three distinct CWM styles. Understanding the concerns and convictions out of which these different strands of CWM originated helps to clarify how these streams have converged and diverged to create the “splintered art world” of worship music today. © The Liturgical Conference.",,,2-s2.0-84994491736

We begin broadly, using companion books to delineate three structural pillars in the scholarship: rhetoric as a formal cultural system, the republic as subject to ruptures and reinventions, and Cicero as a foremost statesman of the late republic. Then we move into scholarship that draws upon nontraditional rhetorical objects, such as art, and that moves into increasingly vibrant areas of interest in rhetoric, such as the senses.

Recent rapid advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing and DNA synthesis techniques are enabling the design and construction of new biological parts (genes), devices (gene networks) and modules (biosynthetic pathways), and the redesign of biological systems (cells and organisms) for useful purposes. In 2014, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae became the first eukaryotic cell to be equipped with a fully functional synthetic chromosome. This was achieved following the synthesis of the first viral (poliovirus in 2002 and bacteriophage Phi-X174 in 2003) and bacterial (Mycoplasma genitalium in 2008 and Mycoplasma mycoides in 2010) genomes, and less than two decades after revealing the full genome sequence of a laboratory (S288c in 1996) and wine (AWRI1631 in 2008) yeast strain. A large international project–the Synthetic Yeast Genome (Sc2.0) Project–is now underway to synthesize all 16 chromosomes (∼12 Mb carrying ∼6000 genes) of the sequenced S288c laboratory strain by 2018. If successful, S. cerevisiae will become the first eukaryote to cross the horizon of in silico design of complex cells through de novo synthesis, reshuffling, and editing of genomes. In the meantime, yeasts are being used as cell factories for the semi-synthetic production of high-value compounds, such as the potent antimalarial artemisinin, and food ingredients, such as resveratrol, vanillin, stevia, nootkatone, and saffron. As a continuum of previously genetically engineered industrially important yeast strains, precision genome engineering is bound to also impact the study and development of wine yeast strains supercharged with synthetic DNA. The first taste of what the future holds is the de novo production of the raspberry ketone aroma compound, 4-[4-hydroxyphenyl]butan-2-one, in a wine yeast strain (AWRI1631), which was recently achieved via metabolic pathway engineering and synthetic enzyme fusion. A peek over the horizon is revealing that the future of “Wine Yeast 2.0” is already here. Therefore, this article seeks to help prepare the wine industry–an industry rich in history and tradition on the one hand, and innovation on the other–for the inevitable intersection of the ancient art practiced by winemakers and the inventive science of pioneering “synthetic genomicists”. It would be prudent to proactively engage all stakeholders–researchers, industry practitioners, policymakers, regulators, commentators, and consumers–in a meaningful dialog about the potential challenges and opportunities emanating from Synthetic Biology. To capitalize on the new vistas of synthetic yeast genomics, this paper presents wine yeast research in a fresh context, raises important questions and proposes new directions. © 2016 The Author(s).

Here, we show how this can be accomplished by measuring and analyzing the colours of the paintings of the influential Portuguese painter Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso (1887-1918). His last paintings have been classified by art historians as the most successful and are considered a chromatically homogeneous nucleus in his career. However, there are no quantitative data supporting these considerations. To access this we compared 24 of his paintings (1911-17) using hyperspectral imaging data. From estimates of the number of colours that can be perceived in each painting we show that in the later works Amadeo has expanded the range of colours by including more hues and more levels of lightness. Moreover, the paintings dated from 1917 have similar chromatic distributions in colour space. This colorimetric analysis revealed to be an important tool that provides quantitative support to the hypothesis formulated by art historians. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Colorimetry; Discernible colours; History of art; Paintings; Spectral imaging","Color; Colorimeters; Colorimetric analysis; History; Hyperspectral imaging; Painting; Spectroscopy; Art historians; Colour spaces; Hyperspectral imaging datum; Key elements; Quantitative data; Spectral imaging; Colorimetry",2-s2.0-85031315837

Art history departments, in their different denominations in Europe and other countries around the world, are concentrated on research and initiatives on the state of art history, on how to revise and question the strategies of its construction, and on the identification of documents and archival material considered its «sources».

The stern Stasi officer in charge of the surveillance of a playwright and his actress partner comes to play the part of a selfless savior, while the victimized actress becomes a betrayer. Her shame however, is not shared by the playwright, Dreyman, and the Stasi officer, Wiesler, who never meet eye to eye but instead become linked in a mutual gratitude centering on the book dedicated to Wiesler, written years later when Dreyman learns of the other's having subversively protected him from imprisonment.

Exhibitions at their grand house in Mayfair brought many private collections and collectors to light, using members’ social connections to draw upon the finest and most diverse objects available. Through their unique mode of presentation, which brought museum-style display and interpretation to a grand domestic-style gallery space, they also brought two forms of curatorial and art historical practice together in one unusual setting, enabling an unrestricted form of connoisseurship, where new categories of art were defined and old ones expanded.

The authors focused their analysis on two broad dimensions of argumentation tasks: (1) Instructional focus categorized tasks as learning to argue, arguing to learn, or interactive argumentation focused on evaluating different possible meanings and interpretations of text. (2) Inquiry space described the degree to which the question, possible claims, and knowledge and skills needed to accomplish an argumentation task were predetermined. Findings point to task characteristics as a potentially powerful influence on instruction and resultant student engagement. Although most of the argumentation tasks focused on arguing to learn, the authors found that both arguing-to-learn and learning-to-argue tasks were frequently based on predetermined questions, answers, and content. In contrast, interactive argumentation was generally shaped by student questions and interpretations. Using contrasting illustrations from observed lessons, the authors theorize about the role of inquiry space in argumentation teaching and learning. Given that students' interactive argumentation often revealed important argumentative reasoning, the authors argue for recognizing these activities as argumentation and exploring their potential in the development of argumentation literacy skills. © 2017 International Literacy Association.","Motivation/engagement; Strategies; Adolescence; and materials; Comprehension; Content literacy; Depth of (higher level; Discussion strategies; Early adolescence; Etc.); Instructional strategies; Literal level; methods; Qualitative; Reading strategies; Research methodology; Sociocognitive; Teaching strategies; Theoretical perspectives",,2-s2.0-85018984497

Drawing on the examples of the Voltron sculpture series by David Smith (1962); Yvonne Rainer’s performance Carriage Discreteness (1966) and Stuart Brisley’s work at the Hille Fellowship Poly Wheel factory (1970), I will propose that observing the production of artworks within industrial environments implies a twofold commitment for art history. On the one hand, investigating artworks relying on industrial materials and production modes calls for the analysis of the “concrete and direct evidence” that materials provide (Didi-Huberman, 2015; Domínguez Rubio, 2012). On the other, they invite consideration of informal archives and “suspect evidence” related to the tacit knowledge of production, subjective self-documentation and oral history (Rosnow and Fine, 1976). Seen from this perspective, artists’ production in the context of industrial culture and workers’ practices of self-managed time both contribute another point of view on how the inscription within the realm of high and low culture is done in art history. At a time when contemporary artistic and curatorial practices show a renewed interest in “outsiders’” artefacts, the different work models and modes adopted by the proposed case studies enable a reading of potential art historical narratives through the lens of working-class studies and the contemporary material turn. © 2017, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya.

Here, we report the first quantitative study of perceived depth in these works, in addition to more recent works by Salvador Dalí. To control for the contribution of monocular depth cues, ratings of the magnitude and coherence of depth were recorded for both stereoscopic and pseudoscopic presentations, with a genuine contribution of stereoscopic cues revealed by a difference between these scores.

It is shown that the rapid development of virtual globes in the early 2000s was due to three factors: the creation of graphics processors for graphics cards (starting from Ge Force 256 in 1999), the launch of commercial satellites with highresolution cameras (ICONOS in 1999 and QuickBird in 2001) and a crucial increase in the speed of communication networks (40 Gbit/s per channel in commercial fiber optic systems in 2002).

Examples of the modern usage of virtual globes are provided, including Russian projects: visualization of a natural territory with a complex terrain, visualizations of spacecraft's orbits, and visualization of an underground geophysical data.

The contributors represent a comprehensive range of period and geographic command from antiquity to modernity, from China and Islam to Europe, from various forms of art history to archaeology, anthropology and material culture studies. Art history is less a single discipline than a series of divergent scholarly fields - in very different historical, geographic and cultural contexts - but all with a visual emphasis on the close examination of objects. These fields focus on different, often incompatible temporal and cultural contexts, yet nonetheless they regard themselves as one coherent discipline - namely the history of art. There are substantive problems in how the sub-fields within the broad-brush generalization called ‘art history’ can speak coherently to each other.

The purpose of this work was to investigate and describe the circumstances surrounding the founding of YMAA Poland (a subordinate to YMAA International) and its activities between 1986-2016. Yang's Martial Arts Association (YMAA) was founded by Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming. The author of this paper proposes to reconstruct the events preceding the establishment of YMAA Poland on the basis of available material, and briefly analyze and present its activity with special focus on its early years. For this purpose, the first part of the paper presents a profile of Dr. Yang Jwing Ming. In a separate section, a summary of the position of martial arts in Poland prior to1986 is presented. At that time a successful attempt was made to contact the Chinese Kung Fu/Tai Chi Master, Dr Yang Jwing-Ming, and is described. This contact, thanks to the efforts of the Polish instructor Tadeusz Gacki, this contact, culminated in the founding of YMAA Poland. The early years of the organisation's activities, and the main directions of its development up to 2016 are described in the last part of the paper. Methods. A qualitative analysis of the sources and the materials collected during the library and archival research was applied. Tadeusz Gacki's private archive provided the primary sources. The most important material was the correspondence between himself and Master Yang, some YMAA documents (including the founding files), video cassettes and photographs. All this material is of historic value and is published for the first time (with the permission of Tadeusz Gacki). The other main source is Tadeusz Gacki the founder of YMAA Poland himself, whom the author interviewed in 2016 and with whom constant contact was maintained while this article was being written. Another important informant was the current president of YMAA Poland, Robert Was (interviewed in 2015), who provided particular information on the current direction of the organisation's development. Information collected during participant observation (YMAA member since 2005) has been used as a supplement. Results. A view of the circumstances of the creation of YMAA Poland emerges from the analysed material. The collected material facilitated the recreation of the historical background to the events preceding the founding of the organisation, and highlighted the main problems the Polish instructors had to deal with in organising such an ambitious project. Thanks to the archival material, supported by interviews with Taduesz Gacki and Robert Was, a more complete insight into the process of establishing the first international Chinese martial arts organization in Poland has been achieved. Conclusions. YMAA Poland was established in 1986 after the first visit of Master Yang Jwing-Ming to Tychy, Poland. It was the first YMAA school outside the US. Since that time, Polish martial arts enthusiasts have benefitted from the opportunity to contact and learn from the world's leading specialists. YMAA Poland has been actively promoting Chinese martial arts in Poland during the 30 years of its activity and has trained many high ranking instructors. It is a dynamic institution, and an important component of the YMAA International community. © Idōkan Poland Association.","Chinese martial arts; Gongfu; History of martial arts; Kung fu; Yang Jwing-Ming; YMAA",,2-s2.0-85021728913

The technique is based on the principles of historicism and dialectics, which helped to identify the continuity in the approaches of the stated problem‟s study. The analysis of theoretical concepts and typologies creating, determined the need for using the typological, comparative, system-structural and historiographic methods. For the international professional community the genre problem is the one of the fundamental problems not only in art theory, but also in art practice, as its solution allows to determine a type of artistic phenomenon and-as a result-specifics of creative method and style. This problem assumes special prominence when changes associated with the emergence of new directions of creative search happen in the art. This is a period that art experienced in the second half of the XX-the beginning of the XXI century. New themes, stories, art solutions actualize the process of interpenetration and mixing genres, and at the same time cause the need for theoretical and methodological reflection. The formation of genre theory in Russian art criticism has made a way from its designation as a category, organically inherent to painting, to complete denial or introducing new meanings expanding its boundaries. At the root of Russian art criticism thought, the understanding of the genre essence is connected to painting. Stable in domestic scientific tradition is a trend of understanding genre as a fundamental category, reflecting the essential properties and connections among phenomena of art world, a complex of formal and content-related characteristics of piece of art. In this approach‟s context, genre is a style function, a style is a product of genre. Genre analysis is proposed as a theoretical and methodological basis for the study of fine arts, as it allows to reveal hidden qualities of art in genre dispositions. Another position defines genre as a function of painting theme. In present conditions, genre problem is actualized because accepted system of concepts in the contemporary conditions of interpenetration and mixing of genres is not enough. © 2017, Ecozone, OAIMDD.

Over the Ditch is an outcome of collaboration between a geographer and an historian, who are also an artist and a designer, working together at the nexus contemporary art practice, geography and history. The project collates and communicates the historical and contemporary experiences of trans-Tasman mobilities by queer New Zealanders and Australians. 'Hopping over the ditch' is an Antipodean colloquialism for trans-Tasman crossing. Over the Ditch explores the trans-Tasman experiences of seven gay men from 1931-2014. The work comprises archival, found and donated photographs from these men, together with ethnopoetic verse created from their diaries, stories and blogs. The site-specific installation takes the form of a journey, with 22 route-markers created from recycled timber, which present a sequence of visual and ethnopoetic narratives. This photo-essay documents the journey of Over the Ditch, retracing a trek through the in situ work. The photomedia installation, together with its reconstruction here, offers a practice-based creative approach to the representation of queer trans- Tasman mobilities over time and space - an approach that uses visual and textual language to reach across disciplines and audiences in order to convey the experiences of queer mobilities across the Tasman.","Creative geography; Experimental geography; Gay; Historical geography; Mobilities; Practice-based approach; Queer; Trans-Tasman",,2-s2.0-85031665323

This article is an attempt to identify the figures portrayed in the triptych and the role they played in the painting. In ideological terms, the triptych reconciles knowledge with faith in a way that both are understood as a virtue. The recording of such a concept relied on references to dependencies between the micro- and macro-cosmos in medical and astronomical relationships. This made it possible for Memling's triptych to convey that the humanist ideals personified in an exemplary life would be appreciated after death. The attainment of heaven was shown through the metaphor of a journey into the hereafter, combined with the difficulty of surmounting the steps of knowledge, as a spiritual process by incorporating portraits of the humanist elite of Bruges and Florence together with famous Byzantine scholars and the model of the Mountain of virtue, wisdom and science which belonged to the Medieval value system and classified all knowledge. Knowledge, acquired step by step, could lead to sanctity. In these 15th-century visions, high upon the mountain was the throne of Philosophy-Wisdom tPhilosophiaSapientia) or, as in the texts by Filarete, the embodiment of Virtus-Sal. In the triptych this is Christ the Sun: The just Judge. A man may want to learn, he active in his everyday life and work f or his glory on Earth and in heaven (Fama-Ratio). This was a new doctrine of pious philosophy (pia philosopiaj that was considered a political and social necessity and a lesson in sanctity, as well as a lest of the virtue of one's character as an ideal of the heritage of antiquity enhanced by the philological studies that were fashionable among the elite.","15th-century netherlandish painting; Bruges. florence; Byzantine scholars; Florentine humanists; Humanism; Iconography; Memling'p triptych; Portraits",,2-s2.0-85031014126

A movement for aesthetic education in the late nineteenth century led to the increasing importance of decorative art and the spread of museums exhibiting such objects. The ideas of German and English art critics and museum workers were widely recognised in many countries, including Russia. In the 1910s, the role and significance of local art museums and industrial art museums in Russia pertained not only to aesthetic issues, but also economic ones. This article analyses archival materials related to the committees established at the Institute for the History of Arts (Petrograd) during the spring and summer of 1917 following the meeting of representatives of the sciences and the arts: here, the creation of a special Ministry of the Arts was discussed. One commission was devoted to the art and handicraft industry. A programmatic report was delivered by V. Ya. Kurbatov, a prominent art historian and researcher of the culture of St Petersburg. The principal propositions of the report can be analysed in the context of other speeches by the same author. In his reports, Kurbatov put forward the idea of establishing museums directly connected with the economic development of the regions rather than ones solely used to conserve and exhibit certain types of objects. He proposed the establishment of a new kind of museum - 'museum-workshops'. Turning to similar initiatives abroad (e. g. the ideas of A. Lichtwark, a museum curator, reformer of aesthetic education, and the director of the Hamburg Kunsthalle for many consecutive years) helps us to clarify the pragmatic aspect of the project. In a sense, one can see a parallel between these projects and the attention given by the Soviet government to provincial museums, from which the authorities also hoped to receive direct economic benefits. Consequently, when it comes to issues surrounding museums, it is possible to see another dimension of the interaction between the centre and province aimed at forming a culturally homogeneous space for both the empire and the Soviet state.","Art; Institute for the History of Arts; Museology; Museum; V.

Main idea behind the paper is to contextualize arts and crafts movement in Zagreb with other similar movements in the Habsburg Monarchy and elsewhere in Europe by pointing out to the political ideas behind the movement. Special emphasis is given to Arts Society and its founder Izidor Kršnjavi, Arts and Crafts Museum, Crafts school, and the first art exhibition in Zagreb. Members of the Art Society considered themselves to be at the crucial turning point of national history. Their role was to preserve the rapidly disappearing national culture which was believed to represent authentic voice of the nation, and to have economic benefits from it. Such ideas were a mixture of (alternative) modernism and antimodernism; antimodernism in terms that there was an idea of decline of national culture in previous times which should be restored. The restoration was imagined to be done in an alternative way by the creation of a small wealthy class of craftsmen and artists, unlike in the West where the big factories dehumanized people and created proletariat. In order to fulfill their duty, the Arts Society established institutions, organized exhibitions and lectures, so they could educate the wider population and a new class of artists and craftsmen. The Arts Society promoted ideals of patriotism and morality through its projects, institutions and education, with the main aims to representing the nation and to legitimize the Monarchy. The Arts and Crafts museum, and the Craft school were following more or less the official policy of the Monarchy in establishing multi-national nation of various cultures, that is, multicultural political nation. One piece of evidence for such claim surely are awards that Kršanjavi and Bolle received from Franz Jozef for their efforts in establishing the School and the Museum.

These attributes not only hinder the categorization of artistic productions, but also challenge the conception of physical and conceptual works, strictly individual or collective, two categories that still dominate the history, theory and aesthetics of contemporary art. This article argues that, in Argentina, this complexity is radicalised by two strands of analysis designated as “identity” and “institutional”. The former is associated with the imaginaries of modernisation that run through the history of Argentinean art, science and technology; the latter refers to the particular logics of growth and expansion of the institutions that have been promoting the confluence of art and technology from the seventies to the present day. In order to show the ways in which both aspects converged in certain initiatives, a 2014 exhibition at the San Martín Cultural Centre, a well-known institution managed by the Government of the City of Buenos Aires, is analysed. After reviewing the imaginings of the future and of innovation that have marked the local circuit, as well as the oscillating institutional developments, the article puts forward possible strategies for exploring imaginaries with a degree of autonomy with respect to the international scene, related to their own research and creation contexts. © 2017, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya.

It approaches art as processual, relational and embedded in broader social, political and cultural contexts. Hence, such an analysis facilitates not only an understanding of individual experiences and worldviews, but also of the broader conceptualisation of art within particular socio-historical contexts. It explores how artists in diaspora imagine, express and constitute their relations with the homeland and their understanding of the past. By juxtaposing their art production with their life histories and trajectories as well as broader socio-historical contexts, the article explores intersections and correspondences between mobility and visual art, and raises the question of how diasporic sociality influences artists and their works as well as how artworks in turn create sociality. © ZRC SAZU, Inštitut za slovensko izseljenstvo in migracije.","Anthropology of art; Argentina; Mobility; Slovenian diaspora; Visual art",,2-s2.0-85032745391

Three moments in our contemporary history are analyzed as reflections of this example of the nation's cultural and architectural patrimony: 1973, 1980 and 2013. Beginning with a review of files held in the Council of National Monuments and our own ethnographic studies, the article presents a reading of the shadows cast by the museum and its collections of works of Art and delves into the collective interpretations of its ethos. The author's thesis suggests that the shots fired at the Museum on September 14th, 1973 broke the halo suspended above the work of art theretofore so carefully protected. The ritualized distance that separated Art from the rest of society was broken, allowing Art to leave the isolation created by the heavy walls of the building. In an analogy that describes the body of the building and the portraits of women cut down by machinegun fire, the article develops the thesis that since that moment in time the bodies of Art will move out into the streets to show their wounds. From that day forth, the Museum would serve as a projection of and a blackboard for displaying the images and stigmata that the silenced bodies stamped upon the surface of its walls, its surrounding trees, its rain gutters and its doors.","Art; Bodies; Dictatorship; Graffitis; Museum; Santiago of Chile",,2-s2.0-85017147988

This manifests in the insistence that, despite producing similar outcomes, students come to recognise themselves as unique and creative. In the twentieth century, art education in the USA has developed methods for extracting supposedly intimate personal expressions from young people, albeit without demanding the technical versatility, historical knowledge and critical reflection required of mature artists - the exception to this, despite its many flaws, being so-called Discipline-Based Art Education, or DBAE. In this article, I begin with reflections on the untapped potential of DBAE to relate to contemporary art practices. My ideas on moral instruction are expanded upon in the second section, when I undertake a 'backwards' history of British and American art education, in which the ideal of art class as a site of intrinsic and authentic meaning-making is challenged by the functional requirements of education. My last section takes up a critique of critical pedagogy, in which I use the example of a project my high school students did about Michael Jackson to challenge ways in which trauma and pleasure are seen by critical pedagogues as features of experience that conflict fatally with the educational ends of individualist autonomy. © 2017 NSEAD/John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Art education history; Discipline-Based Art Education; Jacques Lacan; Michael Jackson; Slavoj Žižek; Visual culture art education",,2-s2.0-85019612736

The humanities are an essential part of liberal arts education and generally include disciplines such as history, literature, religion, philosophy, architecture, or fine arts (e.g., music, painting, sculpture, drama, or film) (). Nursing students identify that liberal arts improve their skills to communicate, think globally, navigate diversity, make decisions, and improve their human selves (), therefore the purposeful inclusion of liberal arts and humanities into nursing pedagogy should be assured.

By last, this article points to the need for implementing a research approach from the social history of art in furtherance of the artist's interests to work on the link between nature, technology and modernization; the relationship of these issues with the historical and cultural circumstances of her native Barran-cabermeja; and the role played by the politicized atmosphere of National University of Colombia in her understanding of art.","Art of santander; Barrancabermeja; Constructivism; Graphic arts",,2-s2.0-85017181495

The initial part of this paper traces the most representative iconographic representations of clubfoot in history to describe how his presence was witnessed since ancient times. Hippocrates, the father of medicine, was the first to present written references about treatment methods of clubfoot. After the dark period of the Middle Ages, during the Renaissance, there were more detailed studies on the disease, with the creation of the first orthopedic orthotics, designed to correct the deformity with the help of famous names in medicine's history. In the XVIII century, as we witness the birth of orthopedics as a distinct discipline in medicine, more and more brilliant minds developed complex orthoses and footwear with the aim of obtaining a proper correction of the deformity. In the last part of the paper, there is a description of the main surgical techniques developed over the years until the return to conservative treatment methods such as the Ponseti method, internationally recognized as the gold standard of treatment, despite the presence of some unresolved issues such as the possible recurrence of the disease. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","Art; Clubfoot; Diagnosis; History; Literature; Treatment","Antiquity; art; clubfoot; conservative treatment; history of medicine; human; Middle Ages; orthopedic manipulation; orthopedic surgery; orthopedics; orthosis; orthotics; Ponseti method; priority journal; Review; shoe; adolescent; child; clubfoot; history; plaster cast; preschool child; procedures; recurrent disease; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Casts, Surgical; Child; Child, Preschool; Clubfoot; History, 15th Century; History, 16th Century; History, 17th Century; History, 18th Century; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; History, Ancient; History, Medieval; Humans; Orthopedic Procedures; Orthopedics; Orthotic Devices; Recurrence; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84978144277

As the dominant collector and patron of art and architecture in the realm, she left a strong mark on Swedish court culture. Her dynastic network among the Northern European courts was extensive, and this helped to make Sweden a major cultural center in Northern Europe in the later seventeenth century. This book represents the first major scholarly publication on the full range of Hedwig Eleonora’s endeavours, from the financing of her court to her place within a larger princely network, to her engagements with various cultural pursuits, to her public image. As the contributors show, despite her high profile, political position, and conspicuous patronage, Hedwig Eleonora experienced little of the animosity directed at many other foreign queens and regents, such as the Medici in France and Henrietta Maria in England. In this way, she provides a model for a different and more successful way of negotiating the difficulties of joining a foreign court; the analysis of her circumstances thus adds a substantial dimension to the study of early modern queenship. Presenting much new scholarship, this volume highlights one extremely significant early modern woman and her imprint on Northern European history, and fosters international awareness of the importance of early modern Scandinavia for European cultural history. © 2017 selection and editorial matter, Kristoffer Neville and Lisa Skogh; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,2-s2.0-85029086117

The scientific perspective co-creates an anthropological-system theory of tourism and recreation, offers selected approaches to cultural tourism, as well as the humanistic theory of martial arts. The problem in this study is to determine the relationship between a range of concepts - ""tourism of martial arts"" and ""scientific tourism"". The paper also presents a reflection on the development of specialised scientific associations. Methods. The main method is participant observation, and in addition, an analysis of sources and literature, and an analysis of two cases were also used. The first of these was an event in Europe, the second in the Far East. Results. This paper is a contribution to the history and sociology of scientific institutions (process of institutionalisation). Participation in the first conference reviewed here combined the characteristics of scientific and cultural tourism; in the second - it combined scientific and sports tourism. The first conference was a major scientific event, and the second one focused more on researchers - martial arts specialists. Conclusions. For participants, their aims from ""scientific tourism"" and ""tourism of martial arts"" go in parallel. The scientific aim is probably the more important.

This paper adopts a particular orientation toward synesthesia, exploring it as a cultural phenomenon common to us all, as an ability that can be learnt instead of an accidental neurological condition. If synesthesia is both a capacity that we are not fully aware of and a way to access what is stored in memory even at the unconscious level, can art help us to bring this awareness back? Bearing upon a close reading of selected artworks created by Johannes Deutsch, a multi-media artist who has been experimenting with synesthesia, the paper argues that synesthesia can become a tool in the hands of contemporary artists to revitalize the Wagnerian ideal of a “total work of art”. This is to be understood as a politics of the senses based on communality rather than individualism, not as an ideology of totalitarian tendencies. Ultimately, the transformative potential of certain art resides in its capacity to foster a pedagogy of the image that is based upon multi-sensoriality, memory and history. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Agamben; Memory; Multi-media arts; Neuroscience; Synesthesia; Total artwork",,2-s2.0-85016206230

Before he emigrated to Poland in 1926, Mole published two poetry collections, a few essays related to art history and some poems.. Formally, Mole's poetry was marked by his interests in Antiquity and Symbolism, and his major themes were love, women, and, later in his career, an idealistic longing for youth. While in Rome he was fascinated by Tizian paintings Sacred and Profane Love, as well as Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa and Rafael's Apollo and Marsyas, published in 1910 in his first book When Flowers Bloomed. During his stay in Rome he also wrote the essay Art and Nature, in which he discussed the relationships among visual art, literature and nature. Poems like Giorgione and Byzantine Madonna make reference to Venice and the monuments he visited during his travels. In terms of ekphrasis, Mole applies a classical approach to underline the beauty and importance of the focal artistic works. His ekphrastic perspective is rather similar to that of romantic poetry. During WW I Mole was captured as a prisoner and sent to Siberia, where he wrote the poems that were eventually collected in Tristia ex Siberia, published in 1920. Despite the fact that Mole was fascinated by Rilke's poetry, which played important role in his artistic development, it is not possible to know whether he was influenced by that author's most famous ekphrastic poem, Archaic Torso of Apollo.

Since the late 1980s contemporary art in Central Asia boomed and it eventually became an alternative public space for the discussion of cultural transformations, social and global processes and problems that local societies faced. Initially the questions raised by many artists concerned issues of lost identity and lost heritage during the period of Soviet domination in the region. Different artists started re-imagining the concept of the Self in their works and criticising the old rigid approaches to geography, history and mobility. Nomadic heritage became one of the central themes in contemporary art of Central Asia in the 1990s. Artists started experimenting with symbols of mobility, fluid borders and imagined geography of the “magic steppe” (see Kudaibergenova 2017, “Punk Shamanism”). Contemporary art in Central Asia continues to serve as a space for social critique and a space for search and re-conceptualisation of new fluid identities, geographies and region's place on the world map. In this paper I critically evaluate three themes connected to the symbolism of Silk Road heritage that many artists engage with – imagined geography, routes, roads and mobility. All three themes are present in the selected case studies of Gulnara Kasmalieva's and Muratbek Djumaliev's TransSiberian Amazons (2005) and A New Silk Road: Algorithm of Survival and Hope (2007) multi-channel video art, Victor and Elena Vorobievs' (Non)Silk Road (2006) performance and photography, Almagul Menlibayeva's My Silk Road to You video-art and photography (2010–2011), Yerbossyn Meldibekov's series on imagining Central Asia and the Mountains of Revolution (2012–2015), and Syrlybek Bekbotaev's Kyrgyz Pass installation (2014–2015) as well as Defenders of Issyk Kul (2014). I trace how artists modernise, mutate and criticise main discourses about Silk Road and what impact this has on the re-imagination processes. © 2017","Central Asia; contemporary art; heritage; imagined geography; Silk Road",,2-s2.0-85006839766

Some clients with learning disability have broken the law and live in hospital. For clients in hospital, treatment can be learning about managing behaviour, feelings and relationships. This treatment is given by different professionals. This treatment is important to help stop these clients getting into trouble with the police again. An important part of treatment is to help clients understand their experiences in relationships. This case study is about Oliver, and how psychologists and an art therapist worked together to help him. Background: Clients with attachment issues are over-represented in learning disability services. Forensic inpatient services are no exception. Treatment pathways comprise multidisciplinary interventions, and skills-based treatments are considered vital to recovery and maintenance of prosocial and adaptive behaviour and reduction in risk. An important aspect of treatment is the psychological intervention to enable clients to understand their early experiences and the way this may have impacted on later relationships and behaviour. Without exploring the difficult early lives that many clients in forensic inpatient services have experienced, skills-based treatments and attempts to facilitate discharge may not be effective. Materials and methods: This case study presents the theoretical background of attachment, autism, learning disability and sexual offending that informed the collaborative multidisciplinary psychological treatment offered to one man with learning disabilities and autism in a secure forensic setting. Results: The introduction of Art Psychotherapy enabled the client to explore his history and the potential internal barriers to his therapeutic progress. Issues of safety and belonging, previously unexplored with this man, were uncovered and these themes were incorporated into his risk formulation and treatment plan. Conclusions: The paper reflects on the specific contribution of Art Psychotherapy in specialist services, and the importance of the collaborative relationship between the Art Psychotherapist and the ward Multi-Disciplinary Team. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Art psychotherapy; Autism; Clinical psychology; Collaborative practice; Learning (intellectual) disabilities; Psychological therapy; Sex offending",,2-s2.0-85031705226

In 1827, he performed the first total maxillectomy on 17-year-old boy. His work inspired many surgeons, who were previously unwilling to remove maxillary tumours. A paleopathological study performed in the Dupuytren museum allowed us to identify a skull from the early 19th century, with a large maxillar tumour. There were indications that this skull was operated according to Gensoul’s technique. The aim of this study is to confirm that this patient had, in fact, received this surgical treatment. This is a historical and descriptive paleopathological study of a skull of the early 19th century of Dupuytren Museum in Paris. The historical research was conducted in collaboration with the French Academy of Medicine and the Museum of Medicine History (Paris). Bones mark cut studies allowed us to confirm that the patient was operated according to the method described by Gensoul in his “Surgical letter” in 1833. Our historical research has allowed us to understand the perspectives of surgeons in the 19th century and the intellectual processes that led to this discovery. At a time when the robotization and industrialization dominate our art, it is interesting to look to our past, our origins, and our history. The study of ancient humans remains and allows us to understand the origin of our specialty and pay tribute to these pioneering surgeons. Their intellectual approach and boldness should be acknowledged and applauded, especially as it is also the key to our success. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Anthropology; History of otorhinolaryngology; Paleopathology; Retrospective diagnosis; Tumour","art; Article; artifact; France; historical research; human; information center; maxilla resection; paleopathology; priority journal; skull; ear nose throat surgery; history; maxilla; Maxillary Neoplasms; otorhinolaryngology; skull; History, 19th Century; Humans; Maxilla; Maxillary Neoplasms; Museums; Otolaryngology; Otorhinolaryngologic Surgical Procedures; Paris; Skull",2-s2.0-84976865539

However, there is one large European cultural space in which both parallels and analogies can be found, as required by the communicative role of art and architecture. In the 1920s and 1930s, a European architecture that was founded on modern features could be found in the architecture of the new Latvian state. Art Deco aesthetics was one of the operative events of the interwar period. Its expression changed along with the changes occurring during this time period, retaining the decorativeness principles of Art Deco. Art Deco aesthetics encompass several distinct but related design trends, including the following: interpretation of elements of folklore - Ansis Cirulis in Latvia and Pavel Janák in Czechoslovakia authored masterfully designed interior examples. Regardless of their creative potential after the First Wold War, artists and architects in many new states were drawn into the stream of contemporary trends - the folkloristic style, which became one of the decisive sources of inspiration for demonstrating national self-determination, which, in turn, is typical of all cultures and civilisations and can sometimes be international. An analogous interpretation of folklore brings these processes together, which allows them to be identified as folkloristic Art Deco trends. There are moments when folkloristic Art Deco as a component of Modernism art and architecture of the 1920-30s organically foreshadows the aesthetics of pre-postmodernism; modernization of the classic form, which has been highlighted directly in the period of the leader cult common in new states. The wish to represent people's self-determination in architecture and the circumstances of this time shaped the monumentality of the masterpieces designed by Jože Plecnik and Eižens Laube in Prague and Jurmala, respectively, and, at the same time, also their distinct consideration for national heritage. Naturally, a cultural basis that is identical for many European countries can be identified in Latvia and Czechoslovakia, rather than art elements of incidental nature that have randomly entered the country. For this reason, the aim of the present paper is to show the ideological context of Latvian and Czechoslovakian architecture.","Architectural history; Art Deco; Folkloristic art; The 1920s and 1930s",,2-s2.0-85028708012

Although famous for her colorful self-portraits and associations with celebrities Diego Rivera and Leon Trotsky, less known is the fact that she had lifelong chronic pain. Frida Kahlo developed poliomyelitis at age 6 years, was in a horrific trolley car accident in her teens, and would eventually endure numerous failed spinal surgeries and, ultimately, limb amputation. She endured several physical, emotional, and psychological traumas in her lifetime, yet through her art, she was able to transcend a life of pain and disability. Of her work, her self-portraits are conspicuous in their capacity to convey her life experience, much of which was imbued with chronic pain. Signs and symptoms of chronic neuropathic pain and central sensitization of nociceptive pathways are evident when analyzing her paintings and medical history. This article uses a narrative approach to describe how events in the life of this artist contributed to her chronic pain. The purpose of this article is to discuss Frida Kahlo’s medical history and her art from a modern pain sciences perspective, and perhaps to increase our understanding of the pain experience from the patient’s perspective. © 2017 American Physical Therapy Association.",,"art; chronic pain; history; mental stress; Mexico; neuralgia; painting; poliomyelitis; postpoliomyelitis syndrome; scoliosis; traffic accident; Accidents, Traffic; Chronic Pain; History, 20th Century; Mexico; Neuralgia; Paintings; Poliomyelitis; Portraits as Topic; Postpoliomyelitis Syndrome; Scoliosis; Stress, Psychological",2-s2.0-85010676916

Kolodny was vital to the initial practice of neurosurgery in the state of Iowa and to the specific development of academic neurosurgery at the University of Iowa. In an effort to improve his surgical outcomes, Kolodny invented a hemostat that bears his name and is still used for cranial hemostasis. He also provided early outcomes of myelomenigocele repair and wrote extensively on bone sarcoma. Kolodny's achievements brought favorable attention to the university and altered the course of neurosurgery at the University of Iowa. Of significant importance, Kolodny influenced and trained Iowa's second neurosurgeon, Olan Hyndman, and this action led the way to the eventual recruitment of the university's first division head of neurosurgery. The purpose of this manuscript is to shed light on Kolodny's important contributions to the development of neurosurgery not only at Iowa, but also in the profession as a whole.

Her parents were teachers. Maria’s mother has died in 1878 of tuberculosis. In 1893 and 1894, respectively, Maria was awarded master’s degrees in physics and in mathematics from the Sorbonne University. In 1895 Maria married Pierre Curie. In 1897 their daughter Irene was born. Maria investigated rays emitted by uranium salts. She hypothesized that the radiation come from atom and called this phenomenon “radioactivity”. In 1898, Maria and Pierre discovered new radioactive elements polonium and radium. In 1902 she isolated pure radium chloride and defined radium atomic mass. In June 1903, Maria supervised by Professor Lippmann was awarded her doctorate in physics from the Sorbonne University of Paris after presentation of the thesis “Investigation of radioactive bodies”. In December 1903, Maria was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, along with her husband Pierre and Henri Becquerel, for their work on radioactivity. In 1904, the daughter Eve was born. On 19 April 1906, Pierre was killed in a road accident in Paris. In 1910 Maria isolated radium as a pure metal. She also defined an international standard for radioactive emissions (curie), published her fundamental results on radioactivity and textbook of radiology. She also defined the international pattern of radium. In 1911, she won her second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry, for her discovery of radium and polonium. In 1914 she was appointed director in the Radium Institute in Paris. During World War I, Maria became the director of the Red Cross Radiology Service and set up France’s first military radiology centre. In May 1932 she has attended the official opening ceremony of the Radium Institute in Warsaw.

Accurate platelet-level investigation, enabled by statistical treatment of outliers in Lagrangian particle tracking, demonstrates a strong influence of outflow graft anastomoses angle on thrombogenicity (platelet residence times and activation state characterized by shear stress accumulation) with significantly reduced TP for acutely-angled anastomosed outflow grafts. The methodology presented in this study provides a device-neutral platform for conducting comprehensive thrombogenicity evaluation of LVAD surgical configurations, empowering optimal patient-focused surgical strategies for long-term treatment and care for advanced heart failure patients. © 2016 by the ASAIO.","flow patterns; Lagrangian tracking; left ventricular assist devices; outflow graft; platelet shear stress history; residence time; thrombogenic risk","Computational fluid dynamics; Flow patterns; Grafts; Lagrange multipliers; Patient treatment; Platelets; Shear flow; Shear stress; Surgery; Lagrangian particle tracking; Lagrangian tracking; Left ventricular assist device (LVAD); Patient specific model; Residence time; State-of-the-art techniques; Statistical treatment; Stress history; Left ventricular assist devices; gadolinium; adult; anastomosis; aorta root; Article; blood clotting; case report; computational fluid dynamics; human; left ventricular assist device; long term care; magnetic resonance angiography; male; outcome assessment; priority journal; prosthesis implantation; risk factor; shear stress; surgical technique; three dimensional imaging; thrombocyte; thrombocyte activation; thrombogenicity; thrombosis; adverse effects; heart assist device; heart failure; hydrodynamics; risk; thrombosis; Adult; Heart Failure; Heart-Assist Devices; Humans; Hydrodynamics; Male; Risk; Thrombosis",2-s2.0-85008473978

Background: The broad social process of organization, professionalization, and specialization that began for various disciplines in America in the mid- 19th century was a reaction to emerging economic, political, and scientific influences including industrialization, urbanization, and technology. For surgeons or, at least, those men who performed surgical operations, the efforts toward group organization provided a means to promote their skills and restrict competition. Methods: An analysis of the published literature, and unpublished documents relating to the creation of the American Medical Association's Section on Surgery. Results: During the 1850s and through the 1870s, a time when surgery was still not considered a separate branch of medicine, the organization of the American Medical Association's Section on Surgery provided the much needed encouragement to surgeons in their quest for professional and specialty recognition. Conclusions: The establishment of the American Medical Association's Section on Surgery in 1859 helped shape the nationwide future of the craft, in particular, surgery's rise as a specialty and profession.

Being less labor intensive, recall methods are more frequently employed in nutritional epidemiological investigations. However, sources of error, which include the participants' inability to fully and accurately recall their intakes as well as limitations inherent in the food composition databases applied to convert the reported food consumption to energy and nutrient intakes, may limit the validity of the generated information. The use of dietary biomarkers is often recommended to overcome such errors and better capture intra-individual variability in intake; nevertheless, it has its own challenges. To address measurement error associated with dietary questionnaires, large epidemiological investigations often integrate sub-studies for the validation and calibration of the questionnaires and/or administer a combination of different assessment methods (e.g. administration of different questionnaires and assessment of biomarker levels). Recent advances in the omics field could enrich the list of reliable nutrition biomarkers, whereas new approaches employing web-based and smart phone applications could reduce respondent burden and, possibly, reporting bias. Novel technologies are increasingly integrated with traditional methods, but some sources of error still remain. In the analyses, food and nutrient intakes always need to be adjusted for total daily energy intake to account for errors related to reporting. © 2017 Naska A et al.","Dietary intake assessment; Dietary questionnaire; Nutritional epidemiological investigation","biological marker; calibration; caloric intake; data base; dietary history; epidemiology; food composition; food diary; food frequency questionnaire; food intake; nutrient uptake; nutritional assessment; online system; recall; Review; self report; smartphone; twenty four hour dietary recall; validation process",2-s2.0-85024504347

Among these disorders, eosinophilic gastroenteritis is an uncommon and heterogeneous disease characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the gastrointestinal tract in the absence of secondary causes, presenting with a variety of gastrointestinal manifestations. Up to now, epidemiology and pathophysiology of eosinophilic gastroenteritis are still unclear. Based on clinical manifestations and depth of eosinophilic infiltration into the gastrointestinal tract wall, eosinophilic gastroenteritis is classified into three different patterns including predominantly mucosal pattern, predominantly muscular pattern, and predominantly serosal pattern. For diagnosing eosinophilic gastroenteritis, it is necessary for clinicians to have a high degree of clinical suspicion. In addition to the gastrointestinal symptoms, other evidences such as laboratory results, radiological findings and endoscopy can also provide important diagnostic evidences for eosinophilic gastroenteritis. And these indirect pieces of information together with histological results will lead to a definitive diagnosis of eosinophilic gastroenteritis. To avoid specific allergen, dietary treatments can be considered as initial treatment strategy before drug treatment. Corticosteroids are the main medication for eosinophilic gastroenteritis and have a dramatic therapeutic efficacy.

They did this by setting the main motif on the vanishing point. In this study, we attempted to clarify experimentally the effect created by a composition in which a painter draws the main motif on the vanishing point of a one-point perspective. For this purpose, we performed an experiment to measure gaze points in viewing paintings. In the experiment, we presented six paintings: two paintings with main motifs on the vanishing points, two edited paintings in which the main motifs on the vanishing points were deleted, and two paintings with main motifs not at the vanishing points. For each painting, we measured the gaze for 30 s. The number of participants analyzed was 18. We observed that viewers looked more at main motifs on vanishing points than at other regions. The same result was demonstrated even when the main motifs were deleted. We also observed that viewers looked more at the vanishing point than at the main motif, which is not on the vanishing point. This suggests that viewers enjoy the main motif by seeing it within peripheral visual field. In addition, viewers looked more at the vanishing point than at other regions even when there was no main motif originally. These results demonstrate the powerful effect of vanishing points. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Gaze analysis; One-point perspective; Vanishing point","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Human computer interaction; User interfaces; Art history; Attractive Region; Gaze analysis; Gaze point; One-point perspective; Peripheral visual field; Vanishing point; Wood-block print; Painting",2-s2.0-85021660382

With a gross area of 860,000 sq ft (80,000 m2), the new terminal has a curvilinear shape 2,164 ft (660 m) long by up to 531 ft (162 m) wide on plan and is classified as an essential facility. Foster + Partners adopted the state-of-the-art performance-based seismic structural design methodology, incorporating nonlinear static pushover and nonlinear response history analysis methods. The roof is one of the primary design features of the new terminal. Framed in structural steel and supported on reinforced concrete columns, it comprises curved plate girders spanning up to 151 ft (46 m) between tubular girders that are faceted on plan and on elevation along the curved perimeter. Beneath the roof the seismic force-resisting systems include reinforced concrete moment frames and shear walls. Following capacity design principles and with innovative reinforcement detailing, the tops of the reinforced concrete roof columns are carefully designed to act as ductile fuses. The fuses limit the maximum seismic demand that can be transferred to the steel roof, which is designed to remain essentially elastic under MCE shaking. © ASCE.",,"Airports; Building materials; Concretes; Reinforced concrete; Roofs; Seismology; Structural design; Design Methodology; Essential facilities; International airport; Nonlinear response history analysis; Nonlinear statics; Reinforced concrete column; State-of-the-art performance; Structural steels; Seismic design",2-s2.0-85019014151

Griušys. The aim of the research is to reveal peculiarities of his creation and to define what image of historical memory is formed by the artist. The reasons for the choice of concrete historical moments are revealed, and the meaning of scenes and features of his artistic expression are explained. The study discovered that the image of Lithuanian history created by P. Griušys covers a wide period of time. It spreads to the moments of the most important battles in Grand Duchy of Lithuania, to the hope of independence and religious strife in the 19th century, and it seeks political upheaval at the end of the 20th century, which brought changes in people lifestyle and their enviroment. The choice of the painted historical events is not based on the commemoration of anniversary dates. The basis is the inner motivation of the artist, which through different aspects actualize historical past. Visually the most innovative and interesting group of P. Griušys painting is distinguished in the research. In this group, we see a responsible approach to historical facts, an attention to detail, a precise and realistic painting style combined with elements of post-modern expression, such as quotations from previous art styles, playful interchangeability of motifs and forms of visual expression or light joking when historical past is associated with the present. This is a new trend in our historical consciousness, which is enshrined by P. Griušys pictorial legacy.","Historical memory; History of Lithuania; P.

With the trained classifier, we are able to assign the category labels to the superpixels of a historical document image under test. Finally, special objects can easily be identified and extracted after analyzing the categorization results.

E-RIHS addresses the experimental problems of knowledge and conservation of heritage materials (collections of art and natural museums, monuments, archaeological sites, archives, libraries, etc.). The cultural artefacts are characterized by complementary methods at multi-scales. The variety and the hybrid are specific of these artefacts and induce complex problems that are not expected in traditional Natural Science: paints, ceramics and glasses, metals, palaeontological specimens, lithic materials, graphic documents, etc. E-RIHS develops in that purpose transnational access to distributed platforms in many European countries. Five complementary accesses are in this way available: FIXLAB (access to fixed platforms for synchrotron, neutrons, ion beams, lasers, etc.), MOLAB (access to mobile examination and analytical methods to study the works in situ), ARCHLAB (access to scientific archives kept in the cultural institutions), DIGILAB (access to a digital infrastructure for the processing of quantitative data, implementing a policy on (re)use of data, choice of data formats, etc.) and finally EXPERTLAB (panels of experts for the implementation of collaborative and multidisciplinary projects for the study, the analysis and the conservation of heritage works).Thus E-RIHS is specifically involved in complex studies for the development of advanced high-resolution analytical and imaging tools.

Pushkin's ""The Undertaker"", created in the Boldino Autumn of 1830 and included in The Belkin Tales. Turning to the creative history of the work, analyzing its content and the image of the central character, considering the problem of its reception, the authors of the paper come to a conclusion that the concept of the little house as the life-creating and miraculous component of its semiosphere is of special importance for its study. The representative meaning of this concept is inextricably linked with the history of its functioning in the creative consciousness of the poet. The special place and meaning in the dictionary of Pushkin's language of the symbolic spaces of ""my penates"", house and little house allows one to see the evolution of these words-concepts on the way to the concept of a little house that in the early 1830s acquired a special scale in the spiritual life of Pushkin. The mastering of this concept in the lyrics (the poems ""Domovoy"" [House Spirit], ""Gorodok"" [Little Town], ""Poslanie k Yudinu"" [The Epistle to Yudin], ""Novosel'e"" [Housewarming], ""Vnov' ya posetil..."" [Again I Visited . . .]) is inextricably linked with the problems of the poet's spiritual life, the formation of his philosophy of self-reliance. Entering the world of poetic novels (""The Lodge in Kolomna"", ""The Bronze Horseman"") and prose (The Belkin Tales, Dubrovsky) sharpens interest in the substantial problems of life, matters of life and death. The world of the Russian province, the issues of daily existence, the image of a small man reveal the philosophical undertones of the concept of the little house. In this respect, the story ""The Undertaker"" in the context of Pushkin's work of the Boldino Autumn becomes a representative of this process. The story of the awakening of the Pushkin hero to life and the discovery of a new little house expands the spiritual space of Pushkin's prose. In the polemic around the story, the philosophical potential of Pushkin's concept of the little house and of the story ""The Undertaker"" is more clearly indicated. Appearing in the atmosphere of the birth of a new Russian prose, of reflections on the genre of the novel as a ""form of time"", The Belkin Tales revealed the historiosophical potential of Pushkin's prose. Simple matters of provincial life acquired an existential character, and the image of the ""little man"" was included in the process of national self-consciousness. An original response to Pushkin's quest was ""Poteryannaya dlya sveta povest'"" [A Story Lost for the Society] by O.I. Senkovsky, who disappeared under the name of A. Belkin. Its parodic meaning is obvious; it developed in other stories of the same author (""Turetskaya tsygaanka"" [A Turkish Gypsy], ""Dzhulio"" [Giulio]), also signed by this pseudonym. The editor of Biblioteka dlya chyeniya parodies the insignificance of the content of The Belkin Tales, he tries to show the lack of characters in their characters. The article first analyzes the story ""Domik na Nikitskoy"" [A Little House in Nikitskaya Street] which appeared in the journal Teleskop under the cryptonym Z and, as the authors claim, is written by M.P. Pogodin. Its content is not only related to Pushkin's ""The Undertaker"", but also reveals the philosophical implication of the concept of the little house and the existential meaning of the character - the undertaker Adrian Prokhorov.","A.V.

The Priesthood of the Virgin Mary has, since the late Middle Ages, become a very popular topic in Roman Catholic theology, with influence also on the iconography of the Latin West. In Byzantine theology this theme has never been articulated as doctrine, whether positively or negatively. However, in Eastern Christian homiletics and hymnography the notion and metaphor of the Virgin's priesthood is easily perceived. Some church fathers compared the Virgin with the Priest and at the same time with the Altar Table, on which ""she has offered to us Christ as Heavenly Bread for the redemption of sins"". In the author's view, through the notion of the Priesthood of the Virgin only, as present in the minds of iconographers, we are able to understand the symbolic meaning of several pictorial motifs which have remained unexplained.","Art; Byzantine; Church; Culture; Hierotopy; History; Iconography; Icons; Image-paradigm; Medieval; Priesthood; Virgin Mary",,2-s2.0-85029908383

It explores a range of ways to represent this absence of the figure: from abject elements such as bodily fluids and waste to surrogate forms including reliquaries, manuscripts, and cloth. The collection focuses on two eras, medieval and modern, when images referencing the absent body have been far more prolific in the history of art. In medieval times, works of art became direct references to the absent corporal essence of a divine being, like Christ, or were used as devotional aids. By contrast, in the modern era artists often reject depictions of the physical body in order to distance themselves from the history of the idealized human form. Through these essays, it becomes apparent, even when the body is not visible in a work of art, it is often still present tangentially. Though the essays in this volume bridge two historical periods, they have coherent thematic links dealing with abjection, embodiment, and phenomenology. Whether figurative or abstract, sacred or secular, medieval or modern, the body maintains a presence in these works even when it is not at first apparent. © 2017 selection and editorial matter, Emily Kelley and Elizabeth Richards Rivenbark.",,,2-s2.0-85029078345

Both types of multiplicities constitute but two different dimensions of a single, self-differentiating difference, “élan vital as the movement of differentiation” (1988, p. 91). The concept of machinic phylum and the corresponding practice of metallurgy follows in A Thousand Plateaus as a radical mutation of Bergson via Simondon and Leroi-Gourhan, putting duration into things, and thus giving voice to matter and its inhering forces. Machinic phylum — encapsulated in metals and their conductive powers and as such weaponised by Turco-Mongol nomads — is confluent with the vision of the avant-garde. Forged by Marinetti, amongst others, the project of the avant-garde has promised to disorganise the human by fostering encounters with inhuman life. The formulation of machinic phylum/metallurgy echoes Bergsonism in its correlation of unformed energetic potentialities and their actual crystallisations into a “technological lineage” (Deleuze and Guattari, 2003, p. 406). The ensuing co-implication is — to borrow a phrase from Difference and Repetition — this “something in the world [that] forces us to think. This something is an object not of recognition but of a fundamental encounter” (Deleuze, 1994, p. 139). The following paper uses the neo-avant-garde art-work of the Polish engineer-turned-artist Marek Konieczny; the music of the contemporary Polish-Jewish jazz guitarist Raphael Rogin´ski, and the desonant kılkopuz folk by the Nogai artist Arslanbek Sultanbekov, to forge a new transversal lineage that reveals art as technology, an affective weapon serving as a conductor of imperceptible forces. This aberrant trajectory will take us through Pieter Saenredam’s seventeenth-century architectural abstraction; a curious of logic of metallic exfoliation rendered in the body and on 36mm film; and, last but not least, sonic mutations generated by a prepared guitar as well as resonant strings made of horse tail hair. In doing so I would like to propose machinic phylum as a method in the emergent field of the Deleuzo-Guattarian onto-aesthetics. Art writing, art research, art philosophy — all thus become a metallurgic practice which resonates with Deleuze’s pursuit of the affects of paint(ing) in Francis Bacon: The Logic of Sensation, fabulating a nomadic line across periods in art history and speculating about art futures. © 2017, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya.

First he examines the history of the aesthetic appreciation of these sites, starting from their early modern reception and from the differentiation of ""Northern"" and ""Mediterranean"" landscapes: while the Mediterranean ones were highly valued already from the 15th-16th centuries on, the ""wilder"" Northern landscapes were admired mainly from Romanticism onwards. This has, among others, an aesthetichistorical reason, namely the birth of the category of the sublime; and in this case the harmonious Mediterranean landscapes and the irregular yet impressive Northern ones relate to each other as the category of beautiful does to the sublime. This is why from Romanticism on Northern landscapes became not only aesthetically valuable, but even more capable than the Southern ones to move the spectator. This is especially because, from a gnoseological point of view, the landscape might be a place - and the landscape representation a means - of self-interpretation. The historical overview is then used to better understand some of the most important characteristics of contemporary Northern landscape interpretations and representations from leading artists of the region, which are analysed in the second part of the article.","Contemporary Nordic art; Landscape representations; Northern art and aesthetics; Romanticism",,2-s2.0-85017283925

We have recently reported that childhood trauma partly mediates the effect of family history on bipolar disorder diagnosis. In light of these findings from the scientific literature, we reviewed the work of British writer Virginia Woolf, who allegedly suffered from bipolar disorder. Her disorder was strongly related to her family background. Moreover, Virginia Woolf was sexually molested by her half siblings for nine years. Her bipolar disorder symptoms presented a pernicious course, associated with hospitalizations, suicidal behavioral, and functional impairment.

Electricity as one of many energy forms is a critical input to developing countries in the struggle to the national self-satisfaction in all domains. Rural electricity supply involved institutions have recently recommended the pump as turbine (PAT)-based micro hydropower plant (MHP) schemes for remote off-grid electrification, mostly from their economic advantages. However, from different published research findings, PAT-based MHP is not only simple and economically feasible, but has presented bottlenecks in the move to its full understanding. Moreover, compared to other clean energy technologies, PAT technology has not found much literature in academic published researches, thus contributing to its limited understanding within the community. Therefore, the PAT literature availability is one way to level up its understanding, which can be helpful to academic and professional communities. In the present study, a state-of-the-art review on the two most challenging PAT aspects, namely PAT performance prediction and PAT flow stability aspects are presented. In the presented literature, the selected energy sources history leading to the actual MHP global adoption was first briefly explained, followed by an intensive literature on PAT operations, where details about PAT selection and performance prediction were provided. Finally, the PAT flow stability aspects where pump-turbine S-shape and Saddle-type characteristics constitute the main focus, were discussed. It is worth an attention to mention that the words “pump-turbine”, “Pump as turbine”, and “reversible pump turbine” are equally used throughout the whole literature.

Patients and methods: In the prospective COPILOTE cohort of HIV-infected patients started on a first-generation PI-containing regimen in 1997-99, the impact of cART history on the failure to achieve immunological response measured at 10 years was assessed by multivariate logistic regression models in the 399 patients with clinical and virological success of cART. Results: Failure of CD4 response (CD4 &gt; 500/mm3) was associated with age ≥40 years at baseline (P &lt; 0.001), CD4 cell counts ≤ 500/mm3 at month 4 (P=0.016) or month 12 (P,0.001) and ≥ 3 months of cART interruption (P=0.016). Factors associated with failure to achieve complete immunological response (CD4 &gt; 500/mm3 and CD4:CD8 ratio &gt; 1) were CD4:CD8 ratio ≤0.8 at month 8 (P &lt; 0.001) or month 12 (P &lt; 0.001), ≥ 3 months of cumulative cART interruption (P=0.011), ≥ 3 antiretroviral regimens (P=0.009) and ≤ 4 treatment lines (P=0.015).

His contribution casts light upon an internationally acclaimed French painter of Dubrovnik origin, Michel Willenich (Miho Vilenik, 1827-1891), who until now has remained neglected by the catalogue surveys of Dubrovnik and Croatian art history. Pucić Croaticised the painter's name and added insightful and until then unknown details to his life and work. He also introduced the reader to the atmosphere of the Paris Salon, major art event of the day, and thus updated his fellow-citizens on the latest art developments in Europe. The research into archival material and catalogues (from 1870 to 1903) of the exhibitions held in Paris and France reveals a productive painting opus of the official painter of the Ministry of Marine and French colonies and a Knight of the Legion of Honour. Within the context of Pucić's miscellaneous and comprehensive work, his interest in art certainly earns an important place. Apart from his rewarding role in the artistic maturing of Vlaho Bukovac, thanks to Medo Pucić, nineteenth-century art history of Dubrovnik and Croatia is richer for yet another figure of Dubrovnik roots-painter Miho Vilenik.","19th century; Art criticism; Dubrovnik; Medo Pucić; Michel Willenich; Miho Vilenik; Painting; Slovinac",,2-s2.0-85021075778

Extending Walter Benjamin's notion that the photographic image uniquely constellates the past and the present - of which ""seeing and then seeing again"" is therefore a form - I show that through his depiction of visual culture, Vladislavić engages critically with South African history in the present, and, consequently, his own historical position as white and thus always already a beneficiary of the apartheid regime. From this, I go on to argue that the method of ""seeing and then seeing again"" inverts the genre of Euroimperial travel writing theorized by Mary Louise Pratt in Imperial Eyes to lay bare questions of scopic power, including Vlad's own. © The Author(s) 2017.","Dialectics; Ivan Vladislavić; Photography; Post-apartheid; Self-reflexivity; South Africa; Travel writing; Visual culture",,2-s2.0-85018179521

Interventions, such as carotid endarterectomy and carotid stenting, effectively reduce the risk of stroke in selected individuals. This review describes the history of carotid interventions, and summarises reliable evidence on the safety and efficacy of these interventions gained from large randomised clinical trials. Early trials comparing carotid endarterectomy to medical therapy alone in symptomatic patients, and asymptomatic patients, demonstrated that endarterectomy halved the risk of stroke and perioperative death in these two unique populations. The absolute risk reduction was smaller in the asymptomatic carotid trials, consistent with their lower absolute stroke risk. More recent trials in symptomatic patients, suggest that carotid stenting has similar long term durability to carotid endarterectomy, but possibly has higher procedural hazards dominated by non-disabling strokes. The Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial-2, along with individual patient data meta-analysis of all asymptomatic trials, will provide reliable evidence for the choice of intervention in asymptomatic patients in whom a decision has been made for carotid revascularisation. Given improvements in effective cardiovascular medical therapy, in particular lipid-lowering medications, there is renewed uncertainty as to whether carotid interventions still provide meaningful net reductions in stroke risk in asymptomatic populations. Four large trials in Europe and the US are currently underway, and are expected to report longterm results in the next decade. It is essential that surgeons, interventionalists, and physicians continue to randomise large numbers of patients from around the world to clarify current uncertainty around the management of asymptomatic carotid stenosis. © 2017 Japan Atherosclerosis Society.","Carotid artery stenosis; Interventions; Stroke prevention","antihypertensive agent; antilipemic agent; antithrombocytic agent; cardiovascular agent; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk; carotid arteriography; carotid artery obstruction; carotid artery stent; carotid artery stenting; carotid artery surgery; carotid endarterectomy; cerebrovascular accident; drug efficacy; embolic protection device; heart infarction; high risk patient; human; meta analysis (topic); percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon; randomized controlled trial (topic); regional anesthesia; Review; risk reduction; systematic review; transient ischemic attack; Carotid Stenosis; evidence based medicine; procedures; stent; Stroke; Carotid Stenosis; Endarterectomy, Carotid; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Stents; Stroke",2-s2.0-85016944005

The paper aims to explore the significance of storytelling and the role of memory in selected works of recent American fiction of Louise Erdrich's Tracks and Toni Morrison's Beloved which speaks about the historical experience of Native Americans in dispossession and the long-term effects of slavery. In literary texts, memory often becomes a starting point for a painful therapeutic process of regeneration of one's roots in order to survive. The painful memories of Afro-Americans and Native Americans as a result of racialized trauma are purged through storytelling and in recounting it as a collective experience between people. Storytelling brings them together engaging them collectively in the events of their lives. As the past and present often overlap with one another it enables them to retrieve their suppressed past. Retrieving the past and sharing their traumatic story gives the opportunity for recovery. Morrison and Erdrich perform the role of a storyteller in narrating the unaccounted through their text since modern communities have no access to the oral narratives of their own past. Storytelling unearths repressed memories in order to find ways of dealing with the pain they cause. Although the writings in the novels of Toni Morrison and Louise Erdrich depict two very different cultures, the Afro-American and the Native American, the trauma which damages the self in their characters is very much similar. This process of narration is essential for the survivors to come to terms with their experience. This narration ultimately creates a sort of emotional distance from the event and makes it less threatening for the characters to reflect upon. It is to be remembered that the authors make use of this technique of storytelling not just to heal the fractures of the readers in the modern psyche but also to rewrite a part of history forgotten by preserving the historical data, their cultural values and the Afro-American and Native American ideas. © AesthetixMS 2016.","Erdrich; Memory; Morrison; Storytelling; Trauma",,2-s2.0-85020842763

Moreover, by using art history to attune ourselves to slut-shaming’s historical emergence, we gain new insights into the present-day dynamics of this mode of inspection and regulation. Presenting a historicised analysis of Vermeer’s painting, ‘A Girl Reading a Letter by an Open Window’, alongside a contextualised approach to the construction of ‘sluts’, this article recalibrates our understanding both of the importance of shame within the surveillance canon and specific modalities of female experience of asymmetrical inspection. Finally, responding to recent calls by Hille Koskela, Kirstie Ball and others for a more explicitly gendered approach to surveillance, I offer a hybrid methodology that brings together (slut-)shame and surveillance discourse in relation to paradigms of discipline. © The author(s), 2017.","Creep; Dutch art; Gender; Shame; Slut; Slut-Shaming; Surveillance; Vermeer; Women",,2-s2.0-85019410990

ART expression is often conditionally determined, and variation in the expression of conditional ARTs due to genetic and/or environmental influences can greatly affect population composition and trajectory. For example, ecological feedback mechanisms resulting from strong density-dependent competition over food have been suggested to explain the observation that the harvesting of scramblers (= sneakers) in closed populations of the bulb mite Rhizoglyphus robini did not result in an increase (expected from quantitative genetics theory) but decrease in fighter expression. Here, we exposed closed bulb mite populations to selective fighter or scrambler harvesting for 5-6 generations under abundant food (to halt ecological feedbacks through density-dependence) to confirm predictions from quantitative genetics theory. However, we found no evolutionary shift in ART expression; rather, we observed an overcompensatory ecological response, whereby the number of fighters increased when we harvested them. Treatment effects on scrambler numbers could not be tested as there were too few in the experimental populations. Further experiments revealed that starved fighters preferentially killed immature males and immature fighters; possibly to reduce male-male competition as e.g. immature fighters have not yet developed their lethal weaponry. If this is so, then harvesting adult fighters reduced the killing pressure on immature males in our experiment, which resulted in an overcompensatory number of immature fighters that matured as adults. Our results highlight the complexity of how individual heterogeneity in ARTs affects the ecological and evolutionary processes that determine population fluctuations.

Originally put forward as a theoretical basis on which to ground the new developments in the theatrical realm that he was trying to introduce, Qi’s concept of gewu later became central to the scholarship and historical narrative of Chinese opera. This paper examines how Qi made use of the Confucian classics and pre-Song dynasty literature to invest the notion with historical depth in tracing back to antiquity the roots of the new (re-)emergence of synchronized performance of singing and dancing that he claimed was best illustrated in Mei’s plays. This article also studies Qi’s theoretical works in conjunction with the historiographical debates of the time.

In addition, based on archival sources, an explanation is provided of the reception of Eduard Wiiralt's work in occupied Estonia until the end of the 1950s. Despite the common belief that Wiiralt was totally ignored during the Stalinist period in Estonia, he was still included in the art history curricula of the official schools of higher education. Many of the students at that time were soon actively helping to restore public recognition to Wiiralt, which occurred after the artist's death in 1954. The introduction of Wiiralt's oeuvre in Estonia was preceded by an exhibition in Moscow in 1956. It is possible that the matchbox picture that was sent to Estonia in a letter on 15 February 1959 was not the first original post-war work by Wiiralt to arrive here. The owner had the picture made into a bookplate that was produced in a large run. Eduard Wiiralt himself is known to have made seven bookplates between 1918 and 1936. It is also possible to document the changes that have occurred in society and the moods of the times through art. From the matchbox picture that Wiiralt drew on Vienna on Christmas Eve in 1944, the year that Estonia lost its independence, one can surmise the artist's belief and hope that his beloved Estonia would someday become free again.","Bookplate; Eduard Wiiralt; Estonian art in exile; Ex libris; Graphics",,2-s2.0-85030976404

The history of India furnishes an amazing picture of the syntheses of many divergent cultural trends which were gradually transformed by a process of mutual adjustment and assimilation. Islam played a significant role in this by contributing to India's multi-cultural and multi-religious ethos, embedding the subcontinent in the Arab-Islamic maritime civilization, stretching from southern Africa to China, particularly in connecting Africa as well as the great Turkic empires of Central Asia. It offers a pertinent example of the interaction of human minds and the effects of cultural and civilizational contacts on indigenous customs, religion, literature and arts. This paper examines the impact of Islam in the Indian Peninsula from three different angles: its political predominance, its intellectual and cultural impact, and finally, its influence on art and architecture. Based mainly on Arabic and Persian sources, the article focuses on the intellectual legacy, achievements and the role that the Indian Muslims played in the Indian subcontinent during the Delhi Sultanate, the first major Islamic political authority to govern large parts of South Asia.

This climate of experimentation has seen a number of cultural geographers openly promote their interests in, and engagements with, the creative arts: some have explicitly developed practices in response to longer-standing geographical interests (e.g., Cresswell, 2013/2014; Gallagher, 2014; Gorman-Murray, 2014; Wylie, with Webster, 2014), while others have more established art practices that inform, and are informed by, their geographical work (e.g., Crouch, 2010; de Leeuw, 2012; Zebracki, n.d.). In this article, I explore the potential of poetry to animate accounts of geographical fieldwork via an intellectual engagement with the ideas and tenets of non-representational theory. I begin by outlining the history of 'poetry as method' in the social sciences and then acknowledge poetry's status within phenomenology. From there, I consider what a post-structuralist account of geographical fieldwork might entail, drawing from Deleuzian philosophy. Then, using three conjoined poems of my own as a vehicle, I critically analyse the work that poems do as research as well as the ways in which they operate in literary terms.","Creative methods; Non-representational theory; Research poetry; Therapeutic art making",,2-s2.0-85026511927

One of the most important specific qualities of the Islamic civilization is that it is a well-balanced civilization that brought together science and faith, struck a balance between spirit and matter and did not separate this world from the Hereafter. This is what distinguishes the Islamic civilization from other civilizations which attach primary importance to the material aspect of life, physical needs and human instincts, and attach greater attention to this world by striving to instantly satisfy desires of the flesh, without finding a proper place for God and the Hereafter in their philosophies and education systems. The Islamic civilization drew humankind closer to God, connected the earth and heavens, subordinated this world to the Hereafter, connected spirit and matter, struck a balance between mind and heart, and created a link between science and faith by elevating the importance of moral development to the level of importance of material progress. It is owing to this that the Islamic civilization gave an immense contribution to the development of global civilization. Another specific characteristic of the Islamic civilization is that it spread the spirit of justice, impartiality and tolerance among people. The result was that people of different beliefs and views lived together in safety, peace and mutual respect, and that mosques stood next to churches, monasteries and synagogues in the lands that were governed by Muslims. This stems primarily from the commandments of the noble Islam according to which nobody must be forced to convert from their religion and beliefs since freedom of religion is guaranteed within the Islamic order. The Islamic civilization in Spain encompasses many fields that left a profound imprint in the Iberian Peninsula and Europe. The cultural climate of Spain in the era of Muslim rule (711-1492) brought about a prospering of different aspects of science and culture. Numerous schools and libraries were established and books were procured due to which the majority of the people were literate. Literature and art flourished. Buildings were constructed and Islamic art with its specific qualities was cultivated. As a result of that movement, Cordoba became the civilization capital of both Spain and the West in general. Many schools were established in it, such as medical and technical schools in addition to the general education and other vocational schools. Hospitals, chemical plants and observatories were also built. The university in Cordoba was a beacon of thought, education and culture, and it made Cordoba the home of science and of a great number of scholars and scientists in medicine, pharmacy, chemistry, astronomy, mathematics and botany. Scholarly disciplines such as philosophy and logic were also studied and busy translation activities were underway. For that reason travelers and people in quest for knowledge and science from different European countries used to come to Cordoba. This scientific and civilizational movement was not limited to Cordoba alone, but also spread into other cities of Spain, such as Granada, Toledo and other cities under Islamic rule. Relevant historical sources state that young men from Europe, particularly from Italy and France, competed to enroll some of the Islamic universities in Andalusia. One of the students of the university in Cordoba was Gerbert, who later became known as Pope Sylvester II. He introduced science of mathematics and Arabic numerals in Italy. The same historical sources also read that Europe was acquainted with Aristotle's manuscripts via the city of Toledo which was a center of bustling translation work from the Arabic into the Latin language. It was in Toledo that many works of Plato and Galen were translated, as were the philosophy manuscripts by Ibn Sina, al-Farabi, Ibn Tufayl, Ibn Bajjah and Ibn Rushd, and the medical manuscripts by Ibn Sina and al-Razi. These manuscripts quickly spread all over Europe and became a mandatory literature at great European universities. Ibn Sina's Al-Qānūn fi al-tibb was considered the fundamental reference book in studies of medicine in Europe for nearly six centuries and was called The Canon of Medicine. This paper cites numerous examples of interaction and unity of religion and science in the times when Islamic culture and civilization flourished in the Iberian Peninsula, the era that lasted for almost eight centuries. © 2017 Medicinska naklada - Zagreb, Croatia.","Cooperation; Islamic civilization; Religion; Science; Spain; Unity","astronomy; botany; chemistry; city; civilization; climate; France; heart; human; human cell; human experiment; Islam; Italy; justice; Latin (language); logic; male; mathematics; morality; publication; safety; scientist; Spain; student; thinking; travel; vocational education; civilization; history; Islam; philosophy; religion; science; Spain; Civilization; History, Ancient; History, Medieval; Humans; Islam; Religion and Science; Religious Philosophies; Science; Spain",2-s2.0-85019091376

Immune correlates of tuberculosis (TB) risk in populations infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remain understudied, despite HIV being associated with a high burden of TB disease. Here we describe plasma cytokine correlates of TB recurrence in a well-characterized cohort of HIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) with a history of prior TB cure. Methods. Study participants were drawn from a prospective cohort study initiated at the conclusion of a randomized clinical trial in which individuals presented with untreated HIV infection and active pulmonary TB. At baseline, ART was initiated, and TB successfully cured. Participants were screened for TB recurrence quarterly for up to 4 years. TB recurrent cases (n = 63) were matched to controls (n = 123) on sex, study arm assignment in the original trial, and month of enrollment with a subset of cases sampled longitudinally at several time-points. Results. Three cytokines were associated with increased rates of TB recurrence in univariate models: interleukin 6 (IL6) (odds ratio [OR] 2.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-5.28, P = .005), IP10 (OR 4.62, 95% CI 1.69-12.65, P = .003), monokine induced by IFN-γ (MIG) (OR 3.11, 95% CI 1.10-8.82, P = .034). Conversely, interferon β (IFNβ) was associated with decreased TB risk (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13-0.87, P = .025). Following multivariate analyses adjusting for covariates IL6, interleukin 1β (IL1β), and interleukin 1Rα (IL1Rα) were associated with increased risk and IFNβ with decreased TB risk. Longitudinal analysis showed that levels of many TB-associated markers, including IL6, IP10, sCD14, and interferon γ (IFNγ) are reduced following TB treatment. Conclusion. These data show that TB recurrence, in HIV-infected individuals on ART is predicted by biomarkers of systemic inflammation, many of which are implicated in more rapid HIV disease progression.

The cause is multifactorial. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is the commonest cause and others being alcohol abuse and concomitant viral hepatitis. The aim of the research was to study the prevalence of LFT abnormalities in PLHA. Methods: The study was carried out in a tertiary care hospital. Evaluation included a detailed history, thorough clinical examination and investigations including a haemogram, serum biochemistry, serology for hepatitis, and CD4 cell count. Results: A total of 247 patients were evaluated. Of these, 212 (85.82%) were on antiretroviral therapy (ART), 111 (44.93%) were on anti-tubercular therapy (ATT), and 94 (38.05%) were on concurrent ATT-ART. Abnormal LFTs were seen in 128/247 (51.82%) PLHA. In the majority (88.28%), the LFT abnormalities were mild. LFT abnormalities were seen in 109/212 (51.4%) patients on ART, in 56/111 (50.5%) patients on ATT, 46/94 (48.93%) patients on concurrent ART-ATT. There was no difference in LFT abnormalities among the three groups nor was there any significant association with alcohol consumption. There was a statistically significant co-relation between albumin/globulin ratio and CD4 count (p = 0.0002).

OBJECTIVE: To determine tuberculosis (TB) incidence rates and associated factors among adolescents living with the human immunodeficiency virus (ALHIV). DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study. Adolescents enrolled in HIV care between January 2005 and 31 December 2013 constituted the study population. The main outcome variable was TB diagnosis during follow-up. Baseline World Health Organization (WHO) clinical stage, CD4 count, previous history of TB and use of isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) were the main independent variables. We estimated TB incidence rates as incident cases per 100 person-years of observation (PYO). Cox regression analysis was used to control for confounders. RESULTS: Of the 1221 adolescents screened, 1072 were studied; 60.1% were girls. TB incidence rate was 16.32 per 100 PYO during pre-antiretroviral therapy (pre-ART) follow-up but declined to 2.25 per 100 PYO after initiation of ART. Advanced WHO clinical stage (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.71, 95%CI 1.69-4.33) and CD4 count <350 cells/μl (aHR 2.28, 95%CI 1.10-4.81) predicted TB incidence in the pre-ART cohort. IPT use was associated with a significant reduction in TB incidence in the ART cohort, but not in the pre-ART group. CONCLUSION: Although TB was a significant problem in ALHIV, timely administration of ART and IPT had a significant protective effect. © 2017 The Union.","INH preventive therapy; Pre-ART; TB incidence","antiretrovirus agent; isoniazid; adolescent; Article; CD4 lymphocyte count; cohort analysis; controlled study; coughing; disease association; Ethiopia; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; incidence; lung tuberculosis; major clinical study; male; patient care; priority journal; retrospective study",2-s2.0-85007569868

Matrix factorization based models have achieved the state-of-the-art success in the personal recommendation tasks by aiming at predicting ratings through learning latent factors of users and items via the rating matrix decomposition. Matrix factorization based models treat ratings as integers which are supposed to be generated from Gaussian distribution assumption all the time, but long-tail distribution widely exists in real rating data. Moreover, these approaches always ignore the semantic meanings of ratings which can expose the underlying attitudes of users with respect to many aspects of items. In this paper we propose a novel non-Gaussian embedding based model for recommender systems (NGEM) that represents each rating as a translation between users and items in the rating-dependent subspace. Then various types of initializations are incorporated into the proposed model to enhance the learned embeddings of users, items and ratings for better optimization. The effectiveness of our proposed model is demonstrated on rating-prediction task by extensive experiments on the real-world data sets. The results also show that different types of initializations help our model achieve an improvement on accuracy in comparison with some state-of-the-art matrix factorization based models. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Rating embedding; Rating prediction; Recommendation; Translation embedding model","Factorization; Forecasting; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Matrix algebra; Rating; Semantics; Latent factor; Long-tail distribution; Matrix decomposition; Matrix factorizations; Personal recommendations; Prediction tasks; Recommendation; State of the art; Recommender systems",2-s2.0-85029476110

In this study, a mixture of 90% CH4 /10% C2H6 diluted in 99% Ar was studied at fuel lean (φ= 0.5) conditions, for pressures around 1, 4, and 10 atm. Using laser absorption diagnostics, the time histories of CO and H2O were recorded between 1400 and 1800 K. Water is a final product from hydrocarbon combustion, and following its formation is a good marker of the completion of the combustion process. Carbon monoxide is an intermediate combustion species, a good marker of incomplete/inefficient combustion, as well as a regulated pollutant for the gas turbine industry. Measurements such as these species time histories are important for validating and assessing chemical kinetics models beyond just ignition delay times and laminar flame speeds. Time-history profiles for these two molecules measured herein were compared to a modern, state-of-The-Art detailed kinetics mechanism as well as to the well-established GRI 3.0 mechanism. Results show that the H2O profile is accurately reproduced by both models. However, discrepancies are observed for the CO profiles. Under the conditions of this study, the measured CO profiles typically increase rapidly after an induction time, reach a maximum and then decrease. This maximum CO mole fraction is often largely over-predicted by the models, whereas the depletion rate of CO past this peak is often over-estimated by the models for pressures above 1 atm. This study demonstrates the need to improve on the accuracy of the HCCO reactions involved in CO formation for pressures of practical interest for the gas turbine industry.

Although SD continues to offer state-of-the-art systems for multi-shaker control, rotating machinery analysis and shock data capture, this story concentrates on the early days of this great company. In those early days, it seemed like every new product was unique to our industry and each one definitely gave customers a new tool which improved their operation and contributed to advancing the state-of-the-art. We were continually breaking new ground. For example, in 1966 we introduced the SD109 Co/ Quad Analyzer. This unit was often used in conjunction with our SD1002 Automatic Mechanical Impedance Measuring System. The SD109 ushered in an era of modal analysis like no one had seen before. For the first time there was instrumentation to let you virtually ""see"" the mode shapes and literally move transducers around to find nodes and anti-nodes on your structure. Those early days also set the tone for product integrity, applications engineering support and customer service which carry forward to this day. In today's marketplace great emphasis is placed on software and digitizing accuracy. These are both important considerations, but what often gets overlooked in the bustle is the critical role played by quality components and engineering to minimize noise, provide alias-free data and optimize data sampling. These deserve to get just as much attention, if not more, than regular software upgrades.

Photography and this flurry of technological advances have accelerated, and even “annihilated,” the material foundations of the time/space nexus dramatically, forever redefining our already-malleable perceptions of space and time. As a consequence, time itself has been the subject of insistent theorization, speculation, and anxiety. This poster presentation explored the relationship of photography to time and its connection to the technological forces and temporal discourses of modernity/postmodernity, which reconditioned patterns of perception. Roland Barthes, for example, wrote that the photograph has a peculiar capacity to transport the past into the present and, thus, to imply the passing of time in general. As a consequence, Barthes argued that all photographs speak of the anxious inevitability of our own death in the future. His analysis poses a challenge to all commentators on photography—what exactly is photography’s relationship to time and to a shifting, increasingly complex temporal perception? My project addresses that question by chronologically analyzing representative samples of vernacular and fine-art photography from throughout the medium’s history while relating them to their technological, scientific, industrial, and cognitive contexts.

It argues that this struggle is both symptomatic of the unique concerns of modernity/postmodernity and is a manifestation of the photographic medium’s conditional relationship to reality—a relationship that arguably has been complicated by digitalization. These trends are shaped by the medium’s status as one among many technologies that redefined time and space. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Modernity; Photography; Technology; Temporality; Time","HTTP; Mobile phones; Passenger cars; Personal computers; Photography; Radio telegraph; Radio telephone; Technology; Telephone sets; Modernity; Passenger train; Poster presentations; Representative sample; Technological advances; Temporal perception; Temporality; Time; Image analysis",2-s2.0-85031282577

Inchofer referred to the bull Apostolici regiminis, published in 1513 by pope Leo X, in order to argue that ""truth does not contradict truth"", and therefore Copernicans were not allowed to use the ""artful distinction"" between what can be said ""according to philosophy"" and what can be said ""according to theology"". It is well known that the aforementioned distinction had been widely used by Aristotelian philosophers since the mid-thirteenth century; and for a long time historians presented it as the hallmark of the so-called 'Averroism', which supposedly accepted a 'double-truth theory' claiming that a doctrine could be true for philosophy while being false for theology (or vice versa). This paper shows that the roots of the principle of the unity of truth, sanctioned by Leo X in his attack against the masters of philosophy who supported 'Alexandrist' and 'Averroist' interpretations of Aristotle's psychology, can be found not only in Aristotle's but also in Averroes' works; that Averroes gave it one of its clearest formulations; and that Averroes had no significant impact on the understanding of the relationship between philosophy and religious beliefs articulated by the thirteenth-century Parisian Arts masters generally labelled as 'Latin Averroists'. Rebuked in 1277 by bishop Tempier for holding that there are ""two contrary truths"", these masters did indeed try to avoid the conflict between Aristotle's philosophy and the teachings of the Christian faith by using Aristotelian logical tools. However one evaluates their strategy, it seems clear that it was within Latin Christian thought that the different conceptions of the dialectic between 'reason' and faith' generated the phantom of 'double truth'.",,,2-s2.0-85031294010

Several breakthroughs have been made over the last decade in understanding the underpinnings of stochastic synchronization. Yet, most of the literature has focused on memoryless switching, where the coupling between the oscillators intermittently changes independently of the switching history. Here, we analytically investigate the synchronization of two one-dimensional coupled nonlinear maps under Markovian switching. We linearize the system in the vicinity of the synchronous solution and examine the mean square asymptotic stability of the error dynamics. By leveraging state-of-the-art techniques in jump linear systems, fundamentals of ergodic theory, and perturbation analysis, we elucidate the potential of Markovian switching in manipulating the stability of synchronization.

The goal of the model-scale ice production is the generation of a material that can represent sea ice in as many aspects as possible. The question therefore is, to what extent model-scale ice complies with this high level requirement and what possible limitations of model-scale ice are encountered. A part of the answer lies in the history of model-scale testing in ice as model ice was originally designed to test ships in ice. The interaction of ships with ice, when breaking level ice, differs from other interaction scenarios in terms of triggered failure processes and consequently in the relevant mechanical properties of the ice. The significance of the forces in particular interaction scenarios is reflected in the applied scaling laws. The standard scaling laws are presented together with published alternatives and their limitation and practicality is evaluated. The relevant interaction forces and ice properties are compiled for level ice breaking, ships in brash ice and offshore structures in slow ice drift. In the production of model-scale ice, the mechanical properties and their measurements play a significant role, as they determine how well the full-scale scenario is scaled. However, latest research in context with earlier published findings indicates that state of the art measurement procedures may not be able to capture the actual ice properties, as the mechanical behavior of model-scale ice might be different than generally presumed. Consequently, this paper presents alternative measurement procedures and highlights existing knowledge gaps which are worthwhile to be addressed in future. © 2017 ASME.",,"Arctic engineering; Mechanical properties; Mechanical testing; Offshore structures; Sea ice; Ship testing; Ships; Failure process; Ice production; Ice properties; Interaction forces; Knowledge gaps; Measurement procedures; Mechanical behavior; State of the art; Ice",2-s2.0-85032199104

In order to facilitate data utilization and consumption in the Semantic Web, without compromising the freedom of people to publish their data, one critical problem is to appropriately interlink such heterogeneous data. This interlinking process is sometimes referred to as Entity Matching, i.e., finding which identifiers refer to the same real-world entity. In this paper, we propose two candidate selection algorithms to improve the scalability of entity matching systems. First of all, we propose HistSim that utilizes the matching histories of the instances to prune instance pairs that are not sufficiently similar to the same pool of other instances. A sigmoid function based thresholding method is proposed to automatically adjust the threshold for such commonality on-the-fly. Furthermore, we propose DisNGram that selects candidate instance pairs by computing a character-level similarity metric on discriminating literal values that are chosen using domain-independent unsupervised learning. Instances are indexed on the chosen predicates' literal values to enable efficient look-up for similar instances. Finally, in order to be able to handle heterogeneous datasets with a large number of predicates, a mechanism for automatically determining predicate comparability is proposed.

The quality of coal is analyzed. It is emphasized that Sakhalin coal features high quality and diff erent properties and, for this reason, enjoys high demand as power-producing fuel, and in the long view, it can become a high-grade raw material for production of metallurgical coke, synthetic liquid fuel, hydrocarbon gas and other coal-chemical products. The authors inform on the coal reserves and resources in the region. The most often used method to extract coal is open pit mining, while the amount of known reserves recoverable with the stripping mining method is small as compared with the geological reserves and totals 169.9 Mt. Major portion of the reserves occurs at such deposits as Solntsevskoe, Vakhrushevskoe, Novikovskoe, Gornozavodskoe, Tikhmenevskoe, Verkhne- Armudanskoe and Tikhonovichskoe.

Comparisons with observations and several reanalyses showed a high dependency on the variations of the nudging configuration.At the global scale, the accordance is very high for extratropical regions and lower in the tropics. A wavenumber truncation of 30, a relatively short e-folding time of 50min, and a plateaushaped nudging profile applied only to divergence and vorticity generally yielded the best results.

However, recent studies show that NMT generally produces fluent but inadequate translations (Tu et al. 2016b; 2016a; He et al. 2016; Tu et al. 2017). This is in contrast to conventional Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), which usually yields adequate but non-fluent translations. It is natural, therefore, to leverage the advantages of both models for better translations, and in this work we propose to incorporate SMT model into NMT framework. More specifically, at each decoding step, SMT offers additional recommendations of generated words based on the decoding information from NMT (e.g., the generated partial translation and attention history). Then we employ an auxiliary classifier to score the SMT recommendations and a gating function to combine the SMT recommendations with NMT generations, both of which are jointly trained within the NMT architecture in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on Chinese-English translation show that the proposed approach achieves significant and consistent improvements over state-of-the-art NMT and SMT systems on multiple NIST test sets.

The Greek, Syriac, Coptic and Latin literary sources make up a random selection of passages which refer to icons. They come mostly from documents of the Council of Nicea (787). Elliger's (1930) and Koch's (1917) studies have strongly influenced the discussions on icons over the past hundred years. At the same time the massive accumulation of archaeological evidence has been showing clearly that the individuals, who shared aniconic views, like Clement of Alexandria or Tertullian represented narrow learned circles of theologians. Eusebius' Letter to Constantia did not emerge among his writings until the 8th century (787). The vestiges of Epiphanius of Salamis' four writings which are critical of images also emerged during the iconoclast period (G. Ostrogorsky). As if running counter all the discussions on images of Christ engaging the Early Church, the acheiropoietoi showed Christians 'a true face' of Jesus, revealed in a miraculous way by the Christ Himself. The literary sources refer to two different traditions of the Edessan acheiropoietos (Acta Thaddaei, Doctrina Addaei), which is documented by the Syriac hymn on the Cathedral Church of Urfa (c.550).

Scholarships were granted to talented, albeit poor young people who thereby obtained the possibility to receive advanced musical education. The role of the beneficiaries was played by organizations (the Moscow Section of the Imperial Russian Musical Society and the Moscow State Duma), as well as by private individuals. Among these scholarships of special interest are those that were named after the outstanding professors of the Moscow and St. Petersburg Conservatories: Nikolai G. Rubinstein, Anton G Rubinstein, Piotr I. Tchaikovsky, Vasily I. Safonov, Dmitri V. Razumovsky, Nikolai I. Zaremba and Nikolai A. Gubert.

The goal of the research is research of the history of the emergence of the ceremonial order, its structure and components. The specified issues have previously been touched upon by historians, philologists and musicologists upon analysis of the ceremonial order of the ""Grace Cup"" and one of its variants - ""For a Cup for the Health of the Sovereign."" The chants of the church ceremonial order are studied by the author based on manuscripts of church singers' books, which include the Ordinary, on linear notes of the late 17th century, including the cycle of chants ""The Grace Cup is still Present."" This presents the main material for research. The topicality of the work is determined by a new angle of study of the chants of the ceremonial order. The author discloses the texts including prayer recitations for the tsar and the army, defines the principles of interaction of the poetic and chant constituent parts. It is shown that in the language of glorifying the ceremonial order ""For a Cup for the Health of the Sovereign"" the poetic and chanting techniques, which emerged in the Christian doxology, are preserved. The glorifying in the texts of the ceremonial order is carried out by means of traditional poetic and chanting techniques, among which the basic ones are the spacious chants and ""festive"" glasy. The basic means of accentuation of significant words in the text is the usages of the fity and litsa. Thereby, in the poetical texts of the festive ceremonies of the time of Peter the Great not only the traditional Christian, but also the state symbolism is accentuated.","Chants of the ceremony of the ""Grace cup""; Church ceremonial chants; Glasy; Prayer recitations for the tsar and the army; Russian sacred music; The art of Russian choral singing",,2-s2.0-85016958114

Several subsequent studies substantiate the great functional burden related to NMS, their progression, and negative effect on quality of life in PD. Additional evidence indicates interesting relationships between striatal dopaminergic function and NMS. The basal ganglia are implicated in the modulation and integration of sensory information and pain, bladder function is under control of both inhibitory (D1) and facilitatory (D2) dopaminergic inputs, finally reduced dopaminergic activity in the mesocortical and mesolimbic pathways is involved in the development of several NMS including mood, motivational, and cognitive alterations. Some NMS fluctuate in response to dopaminergic treatment and are relieved by dopamine replacement therapy, other are insensitive to current therapeutic strategies. The relation among the overall disease complications, perhaps the most important for PD patients and family members' well-being and functionality is dementia that affects most PD patients over the course of disease. Specific pharmacological treatment is lacking, and alternative approaches have been implemented to improve everyday functionality and quality of life. The state of the art suggests that cognitive rehabilitation in PD is possible and may either increase performance or preserve cognitive level over the time. However, it is also evident that cognitive abnormalities in PD are heterogeneous and we still do not have biomarkers to detect early patients at risk for dementia.Cognitive dysfunction is one the most prevalent NMS and is a clinically and functionally important disease milestone. Given the available clinical and imaging evidence it is possible to use cognition to model NMS progression and design nonpharmacological interventions.

By diffuse mass acquisition here, we mean both accretion of stars by unresolved mergers (relative stellar mass growth smaller than 4.5 per cent) as well as in situ star formation when no resolved mergers are detected along the main progenitor branch of a galaxy.We investigate how stellar densities, galaxy sizes and galaxy morphologies (defined via shape parameters derived from the inertia tensor of the stellar density) depend on mergers of different mass ratios. We investigate how stellar densities, effective radii and shape parameters derived from the inertia tensor depend on mergers of different mass ratios. We find strong evidence that diffuse stellar accretion and in situ formation tend to flatten small galaxies over cosmic time, leading to the formation of discs. On the other hand, mergers, and not only the major ones, exhibit a propensity to puff up and destroy stellar discs, confirming the origin of elliptical galaxies. We confirm that mergers grow galaxy sizes more efficiently than diffuse processes (r0.5 ∝ Ms 0.85 and r0.5 ∝ Ms 0.1 on average, respectively) and we also find that elliptical galaxies are more susceptible to grow in size through mergers than disc galaxies with a size-mass evolution r0.5 ∝ Ms 1.2 instead of r0.5 ∝ Ms -0.5 -M0.5 for discs depending on the merger mass ratio. The gas content drives the size-mass evolution due to merger with a faster size growth for gas-poor galaxies r0.5 ∝ Ms 2 than for gas-rich galaxies r0.5 ∝ Ms. © 2016 The Authors.","Galaxies: evolution; Galaxies: formation; Galaxies: interactions; Galaxies: kinematics and dynamics; Methods: numerical",,2-s2.0-85014786252

Attention is also focused on its forays into pop culture (Google poetry). More general questions on the authorship of literary texts in particular are then formulated, and a proposed pluralist conception of authorship as a collective of human and technological actors is presented, based on analysis of generative literature output.","Actor-network theory; Artificial intelligence; Authorship; Generative literature; Glitch art; Google poetics",,2-s2.0-85031120386

The precision and minimal thermal damage provided by ultrafast lasers in the machining of metals and dielectrics also suggests a novel application in obtaining precise cross-sections of fragile, combustible paint layers in artwork and cultural heritage property. Cross-sections of paint and other decorative layers on artwork provide critical information into its history and authenticity. However, the current methodology which uses a scalpel to obtain a cross-section can cause further damage, including crumbling, delamination, and paint compression. Here, we demonstrate the ability to make controlled cross-sections of paint layers with a femtosecond pulsed laser, with minimal damage to the surrounding artwork. The femtosecond laser cutting overcomes challenges such as fragile paint disintegrating under scalpel pressure, or oxidation by the continuous-wave (CW) laser. Variations in laser power and translational speed of the laser while cutting exhibit different benefits for cross-section sampling. The use of femtosecond lasers in studying artwork also presents new possibilities in analyzing, sampling, and cleaning of artwork with minimal destructive effects. © 2017 by the authors.","Art conservation; Cross-section analysis; CW laser; Material processing; Ultrafast laser","Continuous wave lasers; Laser materials processing; Laser optics; Paint; Ultrafast lasers; Ultrashort pulses; Art conservation; Cross-section analysis; Cultural heritages; Destructive effects; Extremely short pulse; Femtosecond pulsed laser; Material processing; Materials processing; Pulsed lasers",2-s2.0-85013750729

However, many objects, such as pottery sherds found in the archaeological record, are fragmentary, making the underlying complete designs unknowable at the scale of the sherd fragment. The challenge to reconstruct and study complete designs is stymied because (1) most fragmentary cultural heritage objects contain only a small portion of the underlying full design, (2) in the case of a stamping application, the same design may be applied multiple times with spatial overlap on one object, and (3) curve patterns detected on an object are usually incomplete and noisy. As a result, traditional curve-pattern matching algorithms, such as Chamfer matching, may perform poorly in identifying the underlying design. We develop a new partial-to-global curve matching algorithm to address these challenges and better identify the full design from a fragmented cultural heritage object. Specifically, we develop the algorithm to identify the designs of the carved wooden paddles of the Southeastern Woodlands from unearthed pottery sherds. A set of pottery sherds, curated at Georgia Southern University, are used to test the proposed algorithm, with promising results. © 2017 SPIE and IS&T.","Composite curve-pattern matching; Cultural heritage; Design identification; Partial matching; Pottery sherd classification; Southeastern Woodlands","Pattern matching; Chamfer matching; Composite curves; Cultural heritage objects; Cultural heritages; Heritage managements; Partial matching; Pattern matching algorithms; Southeastern Woodlands; History",2-s2.0-85009228515

In recent years, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been increasingly used as a novel technique for the inspection of artwork, revealing the stratigraphy of paintings. It has also shown to be an effective tool for vanish layer inspection. OCT is a contactless and non-destructive technique for microstructural imaging of turbid media, originally developed for medical applications. However current OCT instruments have difficulty in paint layer inspection due to the opacity of most pigments. This paper explores the potential of OCT for the investigation of paintings with coloured grounds. Depth scans were processed to determine the light penetration depth at the optical wavelength based on a 1/e light attenuation calculation. The variation in paint opacity was mapped based on the microstructural images and 3D penetration depth profiles was calculated and related back to the construction of the artwork. By determining the light penetration depth over a range of wavelengths the 3D depth perception of a painting with coloured grounds can be characterized optically. © 2017 SPIE.",,"Depth perception; Diagnosis; History; Inspection; Light; Medical applications; Medical imaging; Nondestructive examination; Opacity; Paint; Stratigraphy; Tomography; Heritage conservation; Light attenuation; Light penetration depth; Microstructural images; Non-destructive technique; Novel techniques; Optical diagnostics technique; Optical wavelength; Optical tomography",2-s2.0-85031291895

These applications involve Non-destructive Testing (NDT), Medical analysis (Computer Aid Diagnosis/Detection-CAD), Arts and Archaeology among many others. In the arts and archaeology field, infrared technology provides significant contributions in term of finding defects of possible impaired regions. This has been done through a wide range of different thermographic experiments and infrared methods. The proposed approach here focuses on application of some known factor analysis methods such as standard Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) optimized by gradient-descent-based multiplicative rules (SNMF1) and standard NMF optimized by Non-negative least squares (NNLS) active-set algorithm (SNMF2) and eigen decomposition approaches such as Principal Component Thermography (PCT), Candid Covariance-Free Incremental Principal Component Thermography (CCIPCT) to obtain the thermal features. On one hand, these methods are usually applied as preprocessing before clustering for the purpose of segmentation of possible defects. On the other hand, a wavelet based data fusion combines the data of each method with PCT to increase the accuracy of the algorithm. The quantitative assessment of these approaches indicates considerable segmentation along with the reasonable computational complexity. It shows the promising performance and demonstrated a confirmation for the outlined properties.

The technologies of reproduction and recording invented during the 19th and 20th centuries, such as photography and cinema, led to a reformulation of the relationship between art, technology, and history, which Benjamin examined in various ways. However, we do not find in his texts a philosophy of technology with well-defined principles. Therefore, this article aims at establishing a constellation of themes emerging from his texts, that allows us to clarify the way technology promotes the transformation and creation of aesthetic values. These values are here understood as axes around which the production and the critique of aesthetic phenomena occur. Photography, as a turning point that was incisively studied by the author, is the leading thread in the different readings of his work. The historicity of perception; the political dimension of art; its relation with memory; the element of play: these are the four axes around which a clarification and, whenever possible, an expansion, of Benjamin’s ideas are discussed. © 2017, Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP).

We assessed survival, mortality risk factors and response to antiretroviral therapy (ART). We compared children with early and late access to care. Methods: We used Kaplan-Meier survival curves with Log-rank tests to compare survival time and mortality rates of 245 HIV vertically infected children admitted for care during 2002-2014. Results: Total follow-up sum was 1584.4 person-years. Overall survival was 83.9%. Median age at start of ART was 51.6 (18.0-94.2) months, and median age at death was 8.2 (1.7-10.1) years (mortality rate: 1.7/100 person-years). Pneumonia and sepsis were the main causes of death. Male gender, viral load (VL) ≥100,000 copies, severe immunosuppression, moderate/severe symptoms and history of opportunistic infection were associated with higher mortality in bivariate analysis. Only severe symptoms remained associated in multivariate analysis (P = 0.03). There was no difference in mortality in early compared to late access group. Overall, 217 patients received ART; 192 had a recent VL, of which 116 (59.8%) had ≤400 copies. Variables associated with therapeutic failure were as follows: VL ≥100,000 copies, less immune suppression, age <12 months at admission and age <3 years at ART start. Conclusions: We have a high mortality rate in comparison with developed countries. Although early access did not impact mortality, we detected a trend in favor of early treatment as a protecting factor against mortality.

Those challenges have all worsened during that period. It was one of the main reasons for migration crisis in modern Western Europe and the former Soviet Union. In this connection it is necessary to call attention to the century-long historical experience of cultural adaptation of the Muslim from provinces of the Volga region and the Urals of the Russian Empire in the late XIX - early XX centuries. The purpose of the article is to examine the contribution of one of the Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly's cadi (spiritual judge) Hasan-Gata Gabashi to the development of the Tatar language, arts and theological concepts at the turn of XIX-XX centuries. The main approaches to the study of the problem became historical and biographical method and content analysis. The problem of adaptation of the traditional Muslim society to social and economic changes through H.-G. Gabashi's creativity and activity which was identified in the article means a lot for research. The article elaborated the main issues, which have become the subject of discussions among the Muslim clergy at the beginning of the twentieth century. The article revealed that historical figure was a supporter of the ideas of renovation of Muslim society. It was proved that H.-G.

The early descriptions of autism suggested that it was the result of childhood psychoses or psychodynamic disturbances of parent-child relationships. This flawed conceptualization of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) gave way to advances in medical science, which have established ASD as a neurobiological disorder of early brain development. There are many genetic, epigenetic, metabolic, hormonal, immunological, neuroanatomical and neurophysiological etiologies of ASD, as well as an array of gastrointestinal and other systemic co-morbid disorders. Thus, ASD are a biologically heterogeneous population with extensive neurodiversity. Early identification and understanding of ASD is crucial; interventions at younger ages are associated with improved outcomes. The advent of understanding the biological sub-phenotypes of ASD, along with targeted medical therapies, coupled with a multimodal therapeutic approach that encompasses behavioral, educational, social, speech, occupational, creative arts, and other forms of therapies has created a new and exciting era for individuals with ASD and their families: “personalized” and “precision” medical care based upon underlying biological sub-phenotypes and clinical profiles. For many individuals and their families dealing with the scourge of autism, their long and frustrating diagnostic journey is beginning to come to an end, with a hope for improved outcomes and quality of life. © 2016, Dr. K C Chaudhuri Foundation.","Autism Spectrum Disorder; History; Leo Kanner; Personalized Medicine; Phenotype; Precision Medicine","thyroid hormone; autism; autonomic nervous system; child behavior; clinical evaluation; computer assisted tomography; conditioning; DSM-5; epigenetics; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; gastrointestinal tract examination; genotype; human; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; infection; metabolomics; mineral deficiency; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; outcome assessment; phenotype; positron emission tomography; quality of life; Review; sleep disorder; vitamin deficiency",2-s2.0-84962700824

In the natural environment, a protein spontaneously folds into specific tertiary structure to perform its biological functionality. The main factors that drive proteins to fold are interactions between residues, including hydrophobic interaction, Van der Waals' force and electrostatic interactions. The interactions between residues usually lead to residue-residue contacts, and the prediction of residue-residue contacts should greatly facilitate understanding of protein structures and functionalities. A great variety of techniques have been proposed for residue-residue contacts prediction, including machine learning, statistical models, and linear programing. It should be pointed out that most of these techniques are based on the biological insight of co-evolution, i.e., during the evolutionary history of proteins, a residue's mutation usually leads its contacting partner to mutate accordingly. In this review, we summarize the state-of-art algorithms in this field with emphasis on the construction of statistical models based on biological insights. We also present the evaluation of these algorithms using CASP (critical assessment of techniques for protein structure prediction) targets as well as popular benchmark datasets, and describe the trends in the field of protein contact prediction. © 2017, Science Press.

Representatives of this medical school, just like the empirical doctors, rejected the teleological principle of the human body and the possibility of extrapolating data obtained from anatomical dissections to clinical practice. They also rejected the Hippocratic principle of the etiology and individual character of diseases. In the author’s opinion, rejecting the study of the dead in the interest of learning about the living is related to the particularities of the “world map” of the Methodic doctors, the theoretical teaching basis of whom was natural philosophical atomism and whose clinical thinking was based on a symptomatic approach. The author of the article points out that we learned many concepts of the philosophy of atomism through the works of Aristotle as well. The atomistic world map helps make conclusions about the difference between a living and a dead body that are determined by the presence (or absence) of the movement of atoms. The Methodic doctors, guided by the world map based on atomistic natural philosophy, rejected the practical use of anatomic dissections and consequently, the necessity of conducting them. The Methodic doctors needed theories that would logically explain the phenomena they observed, while for rationalistic doctors theoretical medicine was a motive for experimental studies, whose results would become its foundation. The productivity of natural philosophical trends in the history of medicine was determined by how much the methodology proposed by the doctors responded to the practical tasks of the art of healing. Critical understanding of the medical experience in ancient medical practice became possible thanks to the apodictic research method used by Galen. The integral theoreticalpractical system he created became the historical boundary that separated Ancient Greek rational medicine from the rational medicine of the proto-scientific period (the 2th-16th centuries). © D.A.

We refer to the apparently miraculous “Lazarisation” of these historical specimens, when the application of state-of-the-art scientific techniques brings new life to material in natural history collections. Classical anatomical, histological and palaeontological work established our fundamental understanding of the natural world over centuries of meticulous and dedicated research, much of which remains unsurpassed to this day. Many of these original specimens are still available to active researchers through dedicated permanent collections in the care of universities and museums. An explosion of advancing methods in recent decades has opened new avenues of research that can exploit invaluable historical material. We review the application of novel techniques, primarily new imaging methods, to historic and important specimens. The pursuit of ultra-high resolution magnification, three-dimensional digital modelling, non-invasive scanning techniques, and, increasingly, elemental analyses all have enormous implications for the future of morphology. Palaeontology, comparative anatomy, and development in particular make ideal platforms for the exploitation of these new techniques. These methods are revolutionizing our use of museum collections and reinventing their role in modern morphological research, which comes at a time of increasing threat to collections and museum curation funding. Future innovations in imaging and non-invasive analyses will doubtless accelerate the renewed research efforts dedicated to existing specimens.

The interplay of these factors determined net energy and hence the ability of a given society to divert attention from life-sustaining needs such as agriculture or the attainment of water towards luxuries such as art and scholarship. Indeed humans could not possibly have made it this far through evolutionary time, or even from one generation to the next, without there being some kind of net positive energy, and they could not have constructed such comprehensive cities, civilizations, or wasted so much in war without there being substantial surplus energy in the past. © The Author(s) 2017.",,"Economics; Cottrell; Human cultures; Net energy; Nutrient cycling; Positive energies; Surplus energy; History",2-s2.0-85002250204

The material provided by the two sources of the messianism (Judaism and Christianity) is transformed by the author on the basis of a model taken from quantum physics, and is forming-up the contents of so called ""non-Christianity"". M. Dennes accentuates the fact that ""non-philosophy"" by F. Laruelle has a paradoxical place in history of philosophy: being in a dialogue with modern philosophies and philosophical tradition, it criticizes all history of philosophy at the same time and so it turns out to be beyond the limits of this history and even gets as far as the complete rejection of it. Referring to the book ""Christo-fiction"" by Laruelle, M. Dennes asks the question: to which extent ""non-philosophy"" remaining ""anti-historical"" can at the same time serve as the ground of a certain mode of historicity, which is different from the mode characteristic of the Greek and Western development. In addition, the author demonstrates, how such formulation of the problem leads to the comprehension of the mode of historicity characteristic of Russia. In the S. Horujy' report the ""non-philosophy"" of François Laruelle is treated as a phenomenon belonging to the modern trend of the deterritorialization of philosophy and choosing the way of the deterritorialization into science. Laruelle's way of the deterritorialization is described, in which an interdisciplinary conceptual framework is constructed basing on transformed elements of quantum mechanics. Critical arguments of Husserl, Heidegger and Habermas against the deterritorialization into science are discussed and it is pointed out that non-philosophy exploits also another and directly opposite way of the deterritorialization, that into ""non-semantics"", the discourse with disconnected meanings of its elements. Here non-philosophy becomes close to some currents in avant-garde art, which practiced so called transreason. The author discovers, in particular, profound similarity of discursive positions of Laruelle and Russian oberiuts. The resulting assessment of the combination of two opposite discursive strategies in non-philosophy is presented.","Byzantium; Cerisy conferences; Christianity; Christology; Collider of concepts; Deterritorialization; Discourse; Epistemology; Esthetics; F.

These unique carriers of ancient steppe oral knowledge were called in the vernacular zhyrau, i.e. singers, because they performed a zhyr (a heroic song as well as a laudatory dedication to a high-ranking official). Being obligatory members and leaders of the khan (state) councils, these heroic singers possessed the highest social status in the medieval nomadic tribe and its entire spiritual sphere, performing important social and state functions that are not characteristic of other nomadic singers. Therefore, their worldview, because of this polyfunctionality and specific development of nomadic societies, harmoniously combined ancient knowledge, syncretic art and the system of military-administrative and spiritual management of the nomadic state, modern for that time. Such a worldview requires a special scientific methodology and needs to be studied not only in the context of folkloristics, literary criticism, political science, aesthetics, ethnopsychology, cultural studies and ethnography. There is a wide range of activities of the steppe heroic aoidos, although all of his functions are realized exclusively in the oral form, which is not quite common for European classical or eastern classical systems. In addition, the high status of the singer in the nomadic medieval society formed his unique cultural type as a spiritual teacher of the tribe, a wise khans' instructor, a figure of great state and social importance. And his worldview should also be studied in a comprehensive way: by different methods and in the context of different disciplines. The main of these methods is complex-concentric: A comprehensive and systemic analysis of the object that pulls together all the elements of the whole as a structurally substantial kernel. It is not only relevant for nomadic (syncretic) cultures, but also extremely useful for understanding the general laws of origin and development of art, law and statehood. The worldview of Kazakh (Turkic) singers of the 15th-18th centuries as the dominant phenomenon permeates the entire spiritual basis of the broad cultural-historical and state-political system of nomadic development of the Turkic peoples. © Serials Publications.","Complex-concentric method; Epic; Functions; History; Oral form; Status; Syncretism; Worldview; Zhyrau",,2-s2.0-85032630257

The traditional approach to diagnosis emphasises the importance of thorough clinical and laboratory evaluations to exclude secondary causes of disease. High-resolution CT is a critical initial diagnostic test and acts as a tool to identify patients who should undergo surgical lung biopsy to secure a definitive histological diagnosis of usual interstitial pneumonia pattern. This diagnostic approach faces several challenges. Many patients with suspected idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis present with atypical high-resolution CT characteristics but are unfit for surgical lung biopsy, therefore preventing a confident diagnosis. The state of the art suggests an iterative, multidisciplinary process that incorporates available clinical, laboratory, imaging, and histological features. Recent research has explored genomic techniques to molecularly phenotype patients with interstitial lung disease. In the future, clinicians will probably use blood-specific or lung-specific molecular markers in combination with other clinical, physiological, and imaging features to enhance diagnostic efforts, refine prognostic recommendations, and influence the initial or subsequent treatment options. There is an urgent and increasing need for well designed, large, prospective studies measuring the effect of different diagnostic approaches.

We included identification of copy number variations (CNVs) by whole exome sequencing (WES) using the CNV calling method ExomeDepth to detect gene alterations for which routine Sanger sequencing analysis is not suitable, such as large heterozygous deletions. Methods: Of a total of 12 undiagnosed patients with T-B+NK+ SCID, we analyzed eight probands by WES, using GATK to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions (INDELs) and ExomeDepth to detect CNVs. Results: We found heterozygous single- or multi-exon deletions in IL7R, a known disease gene for autosomal recessive T-B+NK+ SCID, in four families (seven patients). In three families (five patients), these deletions coexisted with a heterozygous splice site or nonsense mutation elsewhere in the same gene, consistent with compound heterozygosity. In our cohort, about a quarter of T-B+NK+ SCID patients (26%) had such compound heterozygous IL7R deletions. Conclusions: We show that heterozygous IL7R exon deletions are common in T-B+NK+ SCID and are detectable by WES.

It is this position proved fruitful for making Dante studies as philological knowledge field in the hermeneutics of a new humanitarian type, for which the ""Divine Comedy"" is not just a text in a number of texts, but sample universal knowledge in the horizon which early Renaissance created his picture of the world. This experience was lost when science and art divided spheres of influence. Mandelstam perceives Dante not as a writer but as a Teacher, just as Dante himself in his poem is respectful and attentive pupil of his great mentor and companion Virgil. Mandelstam has created a synthetic methodology for the analysis of the text uses the terminology of quantum physics and biology, geology and medicine, engineering and science.

It is possible to assume that its alkalinity and strong absorption capacity corresponding most frequently to high content of smectites is beneficial for medicinal purposes, on the other hand, presence of smectites in poliments can cause mechanical instability of the gilding due to swelling effects under increased humidity. Further, pure smectites usually do not allow obtaining a compact layer. Other properties of the bole, as, e.g. elasticity, formability and intense red colour, were sought by painters and goldsmiths and therefore, the boles were more likely represented by mixtures of minerals. We have collected micro-samples of gildings on bole from significant panel paintings and polychrome statues belonging to the most prospective period of the 15th and the early 16th century, when the gilding on bole was occurring most frequently in workshops connected with the most attractive artistic centres of the Central Europe, as, e.g. Southern Germany or Danube region. Non-invasive and micro-analytical methods were applied, with particular attention given to the collection of laboratory micro-pXRD data. It was found out that at the turn of the 15th and the 16th century, clay-rich boles of various compositions started to be replaced by products of intense lateritic weathering with significant contents of free Al hydro-oxides (gibbsite, boehmite). It is the first discovery of natural Al-rich pigment (referring either to bauxite or Al-laterite) in historical paintings ever. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Armenian bole; Bauxite; Historical gilding technology; Poliment; X-ray powder micro-diffraction","Aluminum; Clay products; Painting; Soils; Analytical method; Armenian bole; Bauxite; Mechanical instabilities; Poliment; Preparatory layers; Strong absorptions; X-ray powder; Plating; bauxite; cultural history; cultural tradition; material culture; pigment; technological development; Central Europe",2-s2.0-84994443177

First Bergius, and then Pier (of the BASF, not fortuitously either) developed what was eventually called the Bergius-Pier process, a two-stage process for the liquefaction of coal. It was Matthias Pier who developed the catalysts for the second stage in which the primary products of the first coal-hydrogenation step needed to be upgraded. When he was done, by the late 1940s, many of the hydrotreating (HT), and some of the hydrocracking catalysts we are familiar with had seen the light of day: Co/Ni/Mo/W (mixed) sulphides, supported on alumina, Al2O3:F, or amorphous silica-alumina. The alumina-based catalysts were obviously ready-made for the hydrotreating of petroleum fractions as well, and therefore they were the catalysts of choice when this family of processes took off after WW II, and they also underwent, of course, further development. But it was only in the 1960s that people really started to imagine how these HT catalysts were structured and how they might function, giving rise to a variety of catalyst models under the impact of new spectroscopic techniques, and eventually leading to the Topsøe model and all that. Now, the question before us is: did the greatly increased knowledge of the catalysts affect in any substantial way their further development? Or is it rather the case that fundamental knowledge only started to be acquired when HT catalysis was already almost mature? This paper, then, has two parts: first, the essential features of catalyst development in the pre-Molecular-Aspects era will be reviewed, and then some salient aspects of the modern (so-to-speak) era will be discussed with a view to assess whether or not catalyst development can be seen to be changing, as it was often claimed, from an art to a science in the latter era. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Catalyst development; Heuristic; History; Hydrotreating; Industrial view; Theories","Alumina; Catalysts; Coal; Coal hydrogenation; Coal liquefaction; History; Piers; Alumina-based catalysts; Essential features; Heuristic; Hydrocracking catalysts; Hydrotreating; Industrial view; Spectroscopic technique; Theories; Hydrocracking",2-s2.0-85008682120

This book is the first text produced on the history and theory of Ottoman architecture, drawn up by foreign authors commissioned by Ottomans, for the International Vienna Exhibition. This article reviews the text within the methodological framework based on the deep-seated theoretical studies on ""rhetoric"" (the art of discourse) and re-reads of Usûl-i Mi'mârî-i Osmanî published in 1873 as the first attempt to develop a discourse on architecture writing and architectural theory. The primary objective of the study is to present a textual section of architecture in a specific period of Ottoman history. The study sheds light onto the cognitive world of Ottomans, which usually remains incomprehensible in texts concerning identity, politics, power relations, institutional constructions, culture, art and identity. However, it not only reveals the intellectual stance of the Ottoman Empire in 19th century, but also provides a reinterpretation en masse, of Ottoman writings. In this analysis of architectural discourse, which takes rhetoric as understanding, differentiating and disclosing meaning, the study makes use of important canons of rhetoric. To expound on Usûl-i Mi'mârî-i Osmanî necessitates to be immersed in a history-writing venture, which outstretches from political history to art history, from architecture to architectural history.

Computer-aided canvas removal is desirable for restorers when the painting on canvas they are preparing to restore has acquired over the years a much more salient texture. We propose a new algorithm that combines a cartoon-texture decomposition method with adaptive multiscale thresholding in the frequency domain to isolate and suppress the canvas components. To illustrate the strength of the proposed method, we provide various examples, for acquisitions in both imaging modalities, for paintings with different types of canvas and from different periods.

From the biocultural perspective, cultural processes are rooted in the biological necessities of the human life cycle: specifically human forms of birth, growth, survival, mating, parenting, and sociality. Conversely, from the biocultural perspective, human biological processes are constrained, organized, and developed by culture, which includes technology, culturally specific socioeconomic and political structures, religious and ideological beliefs, and artistic practices such as music, dance, painting, and storytelling. Establishing biocultural theory as a program that self-consciously encompasses the different particular forms of human evolutionary research could help scholars and scientists envision their own specialized areas of research as contributions to a coherent, collective research program. This article argues that a mature biocultural paradigm needs to be informed by at least 7 major research clusters: (a) gene-culture coevolution;(b) human life history theory; (c) evolutionary social psychology; (d) anthropological research on contemporary hunter-gatherers; (e) biocultural socioeconomic and political history; (f) evolutionary aesthetics; and (g) biocultural research in the humanities(religions, ideologies, the history of ideas, and the arts).

The law of war tradition has persisted since the War of Independence, we argue, because of an internal dynamic that makes it both strategically useful and costly for the United States to commit itself to rule-bound warfare. Invoking the laws of war to advance the strategic interests of the United States, American soldiers and statesmen have found, entails consequences beyond their control, making reversals in position more costly and enabling critiques in the language of the law. These entailments, we argue, are built into the enduring strategic value of the laws of war.

Reassessing the figure of scholars and their cartographic practices, this chapter addresses the issue from a still largely unexplored angle, looking into graphical solutions chosen to depict power, in the belief that these solutions have helped to shape the interpretation of the spatiality of power, and influence the very exercising of it. Thus reversing the perspective, and that is investigating the maps of power rather than the power of maps, or the power over maps, it is reconstructed here by means of many empirical examples: those scholars and cartographic genres that have told the history of the spatial representation of power.

Paintings, sculpture, decorative arts, musical or scientific instruments, and armor exerted their own influence on prints, while prints provided artists with paper veneers, templates, and sources of adaptable images. This interdisciplinary collection unites scholars from different fields of art history who elucidate the agency of prints on more traditionally valued media, and vice-versa. Contributors explore how, after translations across traditional geographic, temporal, and material boundaries, original ‘meanings’ may be lost, reconfigured, or subverted in surprising ways, whether a Netherlandish motif graces a cabinet in Italy or the print itself, colored or copied, is integrated into the calligraphic scheme of a Persian royal album. These intertwined relationships yield unexpected yet surprisingly prevalent modes of perception. Andrea Mantegna’s 1470/1500 Battle of the Sea Gods, an engraving that emulates the properties of sculpted relief, was in fact reborn as relief sculpture, and fabrics based on print designs were reapplied to prints, returning color and tactility to the very objects from which the derived. Together, the essays in this volume witness a methodological shift in the study of print, from examining the printed image as an index of an absent invention in another medium - a painting, sculpture, or drawing - to considering its role as a generative, active agent driving modes of invention and perception far beyond the locus of its production. © 2017 selection and editorial matter, Suzanne Karr Schmidt and Edward H.

The objects under consideration range from the quotidian to the exotic, including beds, guns, fans, needle paintings, prints, drawings, mantillas, almanacs, reticules, silver punch bowls, and collage. These material goods may have been intended to enforce and affirm gendered norms, however as the essays demonstrate, their use by subjects frequently put normative formations of gender into question, revealing the impossibility of permanently fixing gender in relation to material goods, concepts, or bodies.

The Vana-Võidu, Suure-Kõpu and Voltveti manor houses were rebuilt in the late neoclassical style between 1830s and 1840s. The wall paintings in these late neoclassical manor houses were made during the second half of the 19th century and were inspired, in all cases, by a desire to achieve the look of an ancient interior. There are Pompeian-style murals in all three manors. In Suure-Kõpu and Vana- Võidu, can see figurative paintings as well as the division of the walls into panels, which is characteristic of the Pompeian style. In Voltveti, there are no figurative paintings and the colour palette - alternating warm and cool pastel shades - is not characteristic of the Pompeian style, but the ornamental motives are derived from antiquity. It is known that different publications about the excavated Campanian cities, were available in Estonia in the 19th century. Apparently, the von Stryk brothers and the painter(s) were able to use the published motifs, because the figurative paintings at Vana-Võidu and Suure- Kõpu are very accurately detailed.","Baltic-German manor house; Conservation; Murals; Pompeian style; Reception of ancient interior",,2-s2.0-85030979426

The project and the book series investigated and presented comprehensively the churches with floral ornaments from the feudalist era in south-western Hungary, a region bordered by Lake Balaton, rivers Danube and Drava, and the states of Austria, Slovenia and Croatia. The outcomes of the research project are based on on-site and archival research, and display the historical data, complete iconography and artistic analysis of seventy churches. The book series is a unique one in Hungarian cultural, ecclesiastical, art historical and ethnographic studies. These churches decorated with floral ornaments were erected in the 16th-19th centuries, all are Calvinists and situated in villages. Fifty-five of them exist even nowadays, while fifteen of them vanished and only written documents and pictures provide an access to them. In the map of the article yellow square indicates existing Renaissance, red square indicates Rococo, blank square indicates ruined churches, halved square signifies painted furniture and ceilings of churches that are preserved in museums, while triangle signifies churches with painted fragments. The author provides an overview of the history of research and presents the work of painting joiners with special regard the joiners' centres in Siklós and Vajszló. She analyses in detail the decorating motifs from which she compiled at the end of the tenth volume of the series a complete motif registry consisting of four hundred elements. Calvinism and Renaissance style played a definitive role in the history of the south-Transdanubian painted churches (picture I), as a result of which in the 16th-17th centuries a rich flowery decoration came into being ignoring sacred representation. The ornaments gradually changed under the influence of various artistic sty les. After the long Renaissance, around 1790, the provincial Rococo style became prevailing, which is best represented by the almost intact church of Drávaivány from 1792 (picture 3). In the first decades of the 19∗ century a folkish neo-Renaissance movement became popular (picture 4), and after 1848 the era of the ornamented painting of churches, just as well as feudalism, ended. The last chapter of the article discusses the place and significance of the southern Transdanubian churches in the history of European and Hungarian art. It highlights the elements coming from the shared European medieval tradition and the local characteristics that developed in the modern era, which provide a specific character for these works of arts. Eventually it presents the practical use and interest of the research project, namely, the restoration of five painted churches (picture 5).",,,2-s2.0-85019152023

It draws on a theoretical framework that integrates a social perspective on spelling with a rejection of idealized conceptions of bilingualism. The analyzed English spellings presented in this article were identified in eight texts that the focal student composed during her English language arts class. Notably, this examination was contextualized within the focal student’s linguistic and schooling history. The resulting findings document that the focal student was a simultaneous bilingual who had a troubled history with formal schooling—the place where many young people learn spelling conventions. The predominant practice that characterized her alternative spellings was her use of conventional English sound-to-letter relationships to create a written echo of the speech patterns of her home, school, and community. When her alternative spelling did not reflect these Englishes, they typically illustrated her familiarity with the normative spelling of particular words. Yet the practices that characterized her spelling meant that they strayed from accepted conventions (e.g., transposition/omission/insertion of letters). The focal student’s alternative spelling practices illustrated her familiarity with the English writing system and the depth of her knowledge of multiple Englishes. © The Author(s) 2017.","Adolescent literacy; Culturally and linguistically diverse students; ESL/ELL; High school context; Spelling",,2-s2.0-85032171753

The article is mainly concerned with the recreation of artistic values in new historical environment which is also the reproduction of a certain ethnic and cultural identity in modern days. In this respect, the Kazakh national costume is analysed as a piece of traditional art that is implemented in modern culture due to specific stylistic, expressive and constructive methods. This methodology calls for thorough knowledge of the Kazakh history, the development of the national costume, its construction and colour palette, the study of ancient technologies and the introduction of new ones which can enrich projective and constructive methods as they inherit cultural and historical experience.

By applying a cryptographic method of incorporating descriptions into his texts, Krleža on the one hand hid his sources, while on the other also revealed them. He hid them in the tissue of fictional texts, and unmasked them using a key work only those familiar with the source could identify. We term this method the use of ""belletristic cryptograms"", and can further categorise it into thematic subgroups of concealed artwork descriptions, naming this whole method the use of hidden ekphrasis. The choice of artworks Krleža describes in his work is comprehensive, diverse and each described differently. Since we are dealing with literary texts, descriptions are often used in the function of a wide array of interpretative strategies of depiction; in some aspects, they are used as a mere glimpse into a piece of art with the goal of visually associating, evoking or minutely symbolizing the incorporeal frame of an artist's mind or of the wider social context. In other aspects, the artworks are richly and meticulously presented with regard to their importance and credibility as they, according to Krleža, possess an ""ethical intelligence"" and ""ethical conscience"". Only Krleža's prose is researched here, and this is done on two levels. We take a look at examples where real art is incorporated into fictional texts in order to determine the significance and meaning of a certain dialogue, mise-en-scene or situation. This is most commonly found in the author's plays, novels and novellas. On the other hand, we can trace a completely opposite method by which artworks enter these texts, where, due to their historic determination and already established worth/ status, they thus re-enter reality, as seen from the perspective of Krleža's life and work, so as to yet again test art history's credibility through the matrix of contemporaneity.

Although the history of traditional puppet art in England is based on the sixteenth century figures, Punch (Pulcinella) and Judy-the prototypes of the Turkish Ibiş and Ihtiyar-its popularity continues even in the modern era. Bernard Shaw, a pioneer of modern British theater, aims to point the satirical sketches comparing William Shakespeare and George Bernard Shaw, and to bring an end to the so-called literary rivalry between Shaw and Shakespeare in his puppet play Shakes versus Shav. Shaw wrote the play in 1949; besides being the last play that forms Shaw’s literary identity, it is one of his shortest plays. When staged, the play takes about a ten minute time, and includes a funny friction between Shaw and Shakespeare. The play covers the discussion of the two playwrights about who the better writer is, as the intellectual equivalent of the traditional stereotypes, Punch and Judy. The play not only includes some quotations from Shakespeare’s works, it also exemplifies the witty literality of Shaw’s style and method. This study, comprising a short historiography of British puppetry, deals with the revived version of traditional puppet art by a modern playwright. The essence of this study is centered on how a modern playwright exemplifies traditional puppet art in Britain, besides projecting the author’s stylistic approach in this sampling. The study briefly summarizes the historical development of British art of puppetry. In general, the paper addresses the emergence of puppets in various cultures, and establishes that the puppet art acts as an important element in the transition from traditional to modern. In addition, the puppet shows of these two world-famous playwrights are valuable in terms of permanence and immortality represented through mutual interaction and social awareness. © 2017, Milli Folklor Dergisi.

Focusing on a largely neglected group of porticoes decorated with painted pergolas that appeared in Rome and environs in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, it tells the story of how an element of the garden-the pergola-became a pictorial topos in portico decoration, and evolved, hand in hand with its real cousin in the garden, into an object for cultural emulation among the educated patrons of early modern Rome. The liminality of both the portico and the pergola at the interface of architecture and garden is key to the interpretation of these architectural and painted forms, which rests on the intersecting frameworks of the classical tradition, natural history, and the cultural identity of the aristocracy. In the mediating space of the Renaissance portico, the illusionism pergola created an art gallery, a natural history museum, and a virtual garden where one could engage in leisurely strolls, learned conversations, appreciation of art, and scientific investigation, as well as extensive travel across time and space. The book proposes the interpretation that the illusionistic pergola was an artistic formula for the early modern perception of nature. © 2017 Natsumi Nonaka.",,,2-s2.0-85024831164

Despite their intellectual and medical engagement with immunization, however, neither group attempted to transform vaccination into a political trope. In the context of the rise of Italian nationalism, despite the abundance of biopolitical metaphors, there is a surprising, notable lack of an immunity paradigm.

However, there have been no published data about the outcomes of such patients until now. Objective: To assess the treatment and programmatic outcomes and factors associated with unfavorable outcomes (treatment failure, death and loss to follow-up from care) among people living with HIV (aged ≥ 10 years) receiving protease inhibitor-based second-line ART under the Integrated HIV Care Program in Myanmar between October 2008 and June 2015. Design: Retrospective cohort study using routinely collected program data. Results: Of 824 adults and adolescents on second-line ART, 52 patients received viral load testing and 19 patients were diagnosed with virological failure. However, their treatment was not modified. At the end of a total follow-up duration of 7 years, 88 (11%) patients died, 35 (4%) were lost to follow-up, 21 (2%) were transferred out to other health facilities and 680 (83%) were still under care. The incidence rate of unfavorable outcomes was 7.9 patients per 100 person years follow-up. Patients with a history of injecting drug use, with a history of lost to follow-up, with a higher baseline viral load and who had received didanosine and abacavir had a higher risk of unfavorable outcomes. Patients with higher baseline C4 counts, those having taken first-line ART at a private clinic, receiving ART at decentralized sites and taking zidovudine and lamivudine had a lower risk of unfavorable outcomes. Conclusions: Long-term outcomes of patients on second-line ART were relatively good in this cohort. Virological failure was relatively low, possibly because of lack of viral load testing. No patient who failed on second-line ART was switched to third-line treatment. The National HIV/ AIDS Program should consider making routine viral load monitoring and third-line ART drugs available after a careful cost–benefit analysis. © 2017 The Author(s).","Died; HIV; Lost to follow-up; Operational research; Virological failure",,2-s2.0-85028544968

In these contexts, women artists developed their careers by adopting innovative approaches to contemporary subjects, techniques, and media. However, while a few women working during these decades have gained significant recognition, many others are still consigned to historical obscurity.

Two focus on evidence of gender biases in several exhibitions and contemporary critical writings; the rest discuss individual artists’ complex relationships to mainstream developments, with attention to gender and political biases, cultural innovations, and the influence of racial/ethnic diversity.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors consider the transformation of social representations as detected by means of a self-administered questionnaire that comprised the following tools: scales to measure the strength of various information sources about Warsaw (school, literature, movies, songs, internet, press, tourist guides, documentaries, interpersonal communication and other); associative networks (de Rosa, 2002) with the stimulus word “Warsaw”; a list of adjectives describing the city and its centre, as well as a list of the most important places in Warsaw. The questionnaires were coded to ensure anonymity of participants while enabling the researcher to administer them for the second time (after the visit). According to the modelling approach to social representations (de Rosa, 2013a), the research was guided by three related hypotheses concerning transformation of social representations of Warsaw. Findings: The results confirmed the hypotheses of potential changes in the representations that shift the focus from Warsaw as “communist” to “green” capital city, and of the role of the Polish language as a “communicative barrier” for recalling specific names of city-places after their visit. Research limitations/implications: Social representations exist in people’s minds, and they include images that are further interpreted (Howarth, 2011). Especially when visitors are asked about places, it is likely that they recall specific images, but not their names. Since the questionnaires required them to write down the answers, words often did not correspond to the volatile and dynamic images that the human mind creates. In spite of recalling a specific park or fountain, participants resorted to general categories and simply wrote “park” or “fountain”. However, this limitation is familiar to the majority of social psychological researchers and very difficult, if not impossible, to overcome. The new research directions launched to integrate the research line of field studies with investigations based on new media offer complementary insights and opportunities (de Rosa and Bocci, 2014). Practical implications: Destination branding has numerous practical implications. According to Ekinci and Hosany (2006), developing efficient communication methods is crucial to launching a distinctive and attractive destination personality. Hosany et al. (2006) have demonstrated that personality traits are ubiquitous in consumers’ evaluations of tourism destinations and therefore promotional campaigns should emphasize the distinctive personality of tourism destinations, based on the emotional components of destination image. European capital cities compete for visitors in the mature and saturated market, where brand strength is positively related to tourism intensity (Mikulić et al., 2016). Originality/value: Examining how social representations of a city are transformed by the visit from the perspective of the supra-disciplinary theory of Moscovici constitutes an original way to link imagery and tourist practices. The major cultural issues, such as history, language, art and traditions affect the theory and practice of urban tourism. For the first time, this theoretical framework is being used in case of a post-communist European destination such as Warsaw. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Associative network; Cultural heritage; Language barrier; Social representations; Warsaw","capital city; cultural heritage; European Union; language; questionnaire survey; sense of place; social change; tourist destination; urban area; France; Germany; Italy; Mazowieckie; Poland [Central Europe]; Spain; United Kingdom; United States; Warsaw [Mazowieckie]",2-s2.0-85028671012

This paper presents aspects related to factors of building the collection and its historical and scientific importance. The ownership of the collection changed over the years. According to Brukenthal's will, after the death of the last male offspring of the family - Hermann von Brukenthal - in 1872, the collections automatically entered in the possession of the Evangelical Church. Initially united with the other collections, the mineral collection was handed over by the then management of the Brukenthal Museum - while retaining ownership rights - to the ""Transylvanian Society for Natural Sciences"", for its museum, therefore moved to the Museum of Natural History. In 1948, in accordance with Decree 176 of August 3, 1948 regarding the state taking over the estate of the church, congregations, communities or individuals, the patrimony of the Brukenthal Museum passed under the administration of the Ministry of Arts and Information. Thus, the Baron's minerals collection arrived in 1957 again to the mother institution, but only in its records, as its physical location was in the Museum's storage. Presently, the collection is in the process of being resituated (Decision no. 614 of November 21, 2005), together with the Brukenthal Museum's entire patrimony, to the Evangelical Church, the rightful owner of the patrimony of the Brukenthal foundation, enriched over time by three barons.

Since the end of 1950s, the company even featured a specialized institution, Cinémathèque Sandoz, which was in charge of the production of specific artistic works with fine arts qualities. Cinémathèque Sandoz brought together a group of remarkable personalities - e.g., the man of letters and fine artist Henri Michaux, the director Éric Duvivier, the nephew of Julien Duvivier, or the director Jean-Daniel Pollet - and thus created, from the both period and contemporary perspective, a unique platform for the production of arthouse films.

The aim of the work is to examine the biodiversity, ecology, and uses of indigenous and cultivated plants; the aesthetic dimension and the sense of the botanical simile; and the keys that the poem offers to dwell into the mythical geography underlying the vision of nature that permeates the period. The examination was done on the basis of the elaboration of a Catalog with the Greek names of plants registered in Homer, their Latin transliterations, the places where they appear, the Spanish and scientific names of the taxa and the mentioned classes of relationhips. The evaluation of the relative importance and relationships of the 59 Greek plant names cited in the Catalog demonstrate that: (i) In the description of indigenous and cultivated plants, native forest communities and their component tree species attain greater importance (19%), including oaks, olive trees, ashes and several conifer species. In the cultural landscape, cereals and grapevines predominate. (ii) Among the botanical references made by Homer, the poetic form of simile -emphasizing comparisons with vegetable elementsis second in importance (17%). (iii) The mythical elements represent 13% of the references, which are given magic-therapeutic powers or assigned supernatural characters focused on certain plants and plant communities, as sacred plants in ritual ceremonies. (iv) The remaining botanical classes make reference to practical uses of the flora, as objects for construction, arts and crafts, sources of foods, forage and so on. We highlight two main conclusions: (i) the founding role of the Homeric poems in regard to Natural History, by introducing both nomenclatural and terminological botany, (ii) the transcendence of the poetic comparison and Homeric myth that considers plants as symbols of the sense and human condition. © 2017, Universidad de Concepcion.

This was a cross-sectional study with 193 participants. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were collected, and their associations with mortality among MDRTB patients were determined. Results and Conclusions. Cough was the commonest finding among these MDRTB patients, with 179 (92.75%) of them presenting with cough, followed by chest X-ray consolidation in 156 patients (80.83%) and history of previous TB treatment in 151 patients (78.24%). Cigarette smoking, HIV positivity, and low CD4 counts were significantly associated with MDRTB mortality, p values of 0.034, 0.044, and 0.048, respectively. Fever on the other hand was at the borderline with p value of 0.059. We conclude that cigarette smoking and HIV status are significant risk factors for mortality among MDRTB patients.

Recent findings: There is a high prevalence of chronic respiratory symptoms, abnormal spirometry and chest radiographic abnormalities among HIV-infected adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa, wherein 90% of the world's HIVinfected children live. The incidence of lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, the most common cause of CLD in the pre-ART era, has declined with increased ART access. Small airways disease, particularly constrictive obliterative bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis, are emerging as leading causes of CLD among HIV-infected adolescents in low-income and middle-income countries. Asthma may be more common in high-income settings. Likely risk factors for CLD include recurrent pulmonary infections, air pollution, HIV-related immune dysfunction, and untreated HIV infection, particularly during critical stages of lung development. Summary: Globally, the importance of HIV-associated CLD as a cause of morbidity and mortality is increasing, especially as survival has improved dramatically with ART and growing numbers of children living with HIV enter adolescence. Further research is urgently needed to elucidate the natural history and pathogenesis of CLD, and to determine optimal screening, diagnostic and treatment strategies.

The placenta as medial boundary constitutes a place for the encounter and becoming of mother and child, not only as sapient beings, but also in their very nature. Before and beyond the difference between self and other, the placenta offers a model of affective symbiogenesis where selves come into existence in and through the very materiality of one another, contradicting the presumed “immunitary logic of selfpreservation.” The section on placental (re)presentation crafts a placentology that accounts for the possibility of ontogenetic becoming in the mother-childplacenta triad, a becoming that breaks with a linear genetic history of origin and authenticity to shape what I call the pregnant city. The paper continues by discussing the placenta’s place and boundary function to explain the place-making capacities that allow the realities of mother and child to co-emerge. The paper concludes by discussing the hospitality offered by the placenta, and how, even after its factual “demise,” the placenta prominently remains present through its traces. The placenta’s residue in the form of microchimeric, ritualized, and social traces reminds us that organisms are all but static, but rather thoroughly mixed, prone to change, and full of specters of future possibilities. Thus, the placenta and its enduring traces encourage us to rethink the nature of our intertwined, constantly altering identities, and to reinstall the original hospitality made possible by the placenta. © 2017 by Johns Hopkins University Press and the Society for Literature, Science, and the Arts.",,,2-s2.0-85020865712

Hodges, courts and legislatures claim in principle to have repudiated the privileging of different-sex over same-sex couples and men over women in the legal regulation of the family. But as struggles over assisted reproductive technologies (ART) demonstrate, in the law of parental recognition such privileging remains. Those who break from traditional norms of gender and sexuality—women who separate motherhood from biological ties (for instance, through surrogacy), and women and men who form families with a same-sex partner—often find their parent-child relationships discounted. This Article explores what it means to fully vindicate gender and sexual-orientation equality in the law of parental recognition. It does so by situating the treatment of families formed through ART within a longer history of parentage. Inequalities that persist in contemporary law are traceable to earlier eras. In initially defining parentage through marriage, the common law embedded parenthood within a gender-hierarchical, heterosexual order. Eventually, courts and legislatures repudiated the common-law regime and protected biological parent-child relationships formed outside marriage. While this effort to derive parental recognition from biological connection was animated by egalitarian impulses, it too operated within a gender-differentiated, heterosexual paradigm. Today, the law increasingly accommodates families formed through ART, and, in doing so, recognizes parents on not only biological but also social grounds. Yet, as courts and legislatures approach the parental claims of women and same-sex couples within existing frameworks organized around marital and biological relationships, they reproduce some of the very gender- and sexuality-based asymmetries embedded in those frameworks. With biological connection continuing to anchor nonmarital parenthood, unmarried gays and lesbians face barriers to parental recognition. With the gender-differentiated, heterosexual family continuing to structure marital parenthood, the law organizes the legal family around a biological mother. Against this backdrop, nonbiological mothers in different-sex couples, as well as nonbiological fathers in same-sex couples, struggle for parental recognition. To protect the parental interests of women and of gays and lesbians, this Article urges greater emphasis on parenthood’s social dimensions. Of course, as our common law origins demonstrate, the law has long recognized parental relationships on social and not simply biological grounds. But today, commitments to equality require reorienting family law in ways that ground parental recognition more fully and evenhandedly in social contributions. While this Article focuses primarily on reform of family law at the state level, it also contemplates eventual constitutional oversight. © 2017, Yale Law Journal.

Materials are most often heterogeneous and organized in several layers such as mural paintings or corrosion products. The characterization of a complete artwork's stratigraphy is actually one of the questions of science conservation. Indeed, the knowledge of these layers allows completing the history of the work of art and a better understanding of alteration processes in order to set up an appropriate conservation action. The LIBS technique has been employed to study the stratigraphy of an artwork thanks to the ablation laser. However, as we know, atomic information could be insufficient to characterize two materials composed by the same based elements. Therefore, an additional molecular analysis, like Raman spectroscopy; is sometimes necessary for a better identification of the material in particular for organic coatings in cultural heritage. We suggest in this study to use Standard Normal Variate (SNV) as a common normalization for different kinds of spectra (LIBS and Raman spectroscopy) combined with a 3D colour representation for stratigraphic identification of the different layers composing the complex material from artwork. So in this investigation, the SNV method will be applied on LIBS and Raman spectra but also on baseline Raman spectra often considering as nuisance. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the versatility of SNV applied on varied spectra like LIBS, Raman spectra as well as the luminescence background. This original work considers the SNV with a 3D colour representation as a probable new perspective for an easy recognition of a structure layered with a direct overview of the depth profile of the artwork. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Cultural heritage; Libs; Luminescence background; Raman; SNV; Stratigraphy","Luminescence; Organic coatings; Raman scattering; Raman spectroscopy; Stratigraphy; Conservation actions; Corrosion products; Cultural heritages; Libs; Molecular analysis; Raman; Signal normalization; Standard normal variates; Characterization",2-s2.0-84998698719

In Lan Lan's poetry about pre-modern socialist production, the poet in productive aesthetics questions the now-human condition by presenting realistically an ideal mode of production realized in the past. In Shu Ting's poem ""Streamlines,"" the poet declares her antithetical relationship to the ""status quo"" in resisting the homogenization caused by mechanized production. The aesthetic stand loses its critical power in Zi Li's poem ""Finger Pains,"" which describes the alienation in market capitalism. The poet constructs a self-enclosed aesthetic world by dissociating the fate of individual from its social context. In Xiaoqiong Zheng's poems about the fully alienated life of workers in the twenty-first century, the poet returns to the productive stand and presents a dereified relationship among workers through disclosing sociality as determined by the infrastructure.","Aesthetic aesthetics; Alienation; Labor; Productive aesthetics",,2-s2.0-85018793689

Monotherapy with the integrase inhibitor (INSTI) dolutegravir (DTG) may offer a favourable safety profile. Additionally, DTG has a high barrier of resistance, crucial for successful maintenance of virological control. However, published data is sparse. Methods: Retrospective, single-centre cohort study. We enrolled patients on suppressive ART who were switched to DTG monotherapy in routine clinical practice and fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: HIV RNA level <50 copies/ml for ≥6 months at time of switch (one blip <200 copies/ml with re-suppression accepted), no known INSTI resistance or prior INSTI failure, no replicative HBV infection and no history of AIDS. Results: We identified 31 patients with 24-weeks of follow-up data. Previous ART included a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, a boosted protease inhibitor or an INSTI in 32%, 6% and 61% of patients, respectively. At week 24, HIV RNA remained <50 copies/ml in all but two patients (94%). One patient chose to discontinue DTG monotherapy and another developed confirmed virological failure (HIV RNA 538 copies/ml) with new INSTI mutations (Q148H/G140S). Immune status and renal and metabolic function showed no statistically significant changes, apart from a significant decrease in gamma-glutamyl transferase. Conclusions: De-escalating to DTG monotherapy in selected patients might be a safe and feasible option. However, in one case evolution of INSTI resistance was observed. Further studies should assess particular risk factors for DTG monotherapy failure.

Within a prospective cohort based at two public sector ART clinics, BP was measured at ART initiation and every 6 months thereafter as a routine clinic procedure. Predictors of HBP (systolic BP ≥140 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg) during one year on ART were analyzed using logistic regression, and the proportion with HTN (2+ episodes of HBP >3 months apart) described. A phone survey was used to understand patient awareness of HBP, use of anti-hypertensive drugs, and history of cardiovascular events (CVE; myocardial infarction or stroke). Among 896 cohort participants, 887 (99.0%) had at least one BP measurement, 98 (10.9%) had HBP, and 57 (6.4%) had HTN. Increasing age (10-year increase in age: adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20–1.93), male sex (AOR = 2.33, 95% CI 1.43–3.80), and overweight/ obesity (AOR = 4.07; 95% CI 1.94–8.53) were associated with HBP. Among 66 patients with HBP, 35 (53.0%) reported awareness of the condition, and nine (25.7%) of these reported having had a CVE. Only 14 (21.2%) of those reached reported ever taking an anti-hypertensive drug, and one (1.5%) was currently on treatment.

Particularly patients with a history of cancer have a high risk of developing hypogonadism as a result of not only the nature of the disease, but mainly its treatment. While leaving the patient with cancer without treatment does not fall within the concept of the art of medicine and the ethical canon of a physician, the symptoms of hypogonadism are often ignored and left untreated.

When the printing press was invented, calligraphy made itself compatible with its technical requirements and was replaced by typing in the field of communications. In the present era with the advent of the computer, writing also needs to keep pace with new technology. In the current srudy such adaptation means creating geometry and more formal order in Persian writing characters in order to create a form more consistent with the performance of computers. Persian types, whether when they were used in printing machines or today in computers, lack a repeating geometric order in accordance with applicable tools (computers and printers), so that for example, repeating angles in most of the letters are variable and this irregular geometry in Persian writing causes chaos in the final product. To verify this issue, two kinds of typing, i.e., Lotus and Adobe Arabic are analyzed in the current study in terms of recurring angles in all of their characters. The reason for this choice is that both types have been designed based on the Badr typing yet the first one is more calligraphic and the second is more geometric and mostly bears the fundamental principles of the visual arts. Therefore, it could be said that they have two quite different aspects. The real question is: is it is possible to systematize main angles in Persian writing letters? And whether all or most of these angles are repeated in other letters? The study methodology was descriptive-analytic and its approach was Gestalt psychology with an emphasis on art theory and visual perception proposed by Rudolf Arnheim. The objective of this study were to review the necessity of the existence of recurring (i.e., repeating) angles in the series of the characters of two above mentioned typing and also finding the repetition of angles in the geometric order of typing and typing family. The results show that the existence of similarity in the angles in all letters of a typing can lead to the formation of a geometrical order in the form of characters and also creation of different characters in different typing kinds. © Medwell Journals, 2017.","Character's angles; Consistency with computer; Geometrical order; Letters design; Visual perception",,2-s2.0-85029115569

We conducted a study to evaluate an information and communication technology intervention to increase linkage to community care among HIVinfected persons recently involved in the criminal justice (CJ) system. Baseline characteristics including risk behaviors and HIV care indicators are reported and stratified by gender. Methods We recruited HIV-infected individuals in the District of Columbia jail and persons with a recent history of incarceration through community and street outreach. Participants completed a baseline computer-assisted personal interview regarding HIV care and antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence, substance use, and sexual behaviors. CD4 and HIV plasma viral load testing were performed at baseline or obtained through medical records. Data were analyzed for the sample overall and stratified by gender. Results Of 110 individuals, 70% were community-enrolled, mean age was 40 (SD = 10.5), 85% were Black, and 58% were male, 24% female, and 18% transgender women. Nearly half (47%) had condomless sex in the three months prior to incarceration. Although drug dependence and hazardous alcohol use were highly prevalent overall, transgender women were more likely to have participated in drug treatment than men and women (90%, 61%, and 50% respectively; p = 0.01). Prior to their most recent incarceration, 80% had an HIV provider and 91% had ever taken ART. Among those, only 51% reported ≥90% ART adherence. Fewer women (67%) had received HIV medications during their last incarceration compared to men (96%) and transgender women (95%; p = 0.001). Although neither was statistically significant, transgender women and men had higher proportions of baseline HIV viral suppression compared to women (80%, 69%, and 48.0% respectively, p>0.05); a higher proportion of women had a CD4 count ≤ 200 compared to men and transgender women (17%, 8% and 5% respectively; p>0.05). Conclusions In this study, HIV-infected persons with recent incarceration in Washington, DC reported important risk factors and co-morbidities, yet the majority had access to HIV care and ART prior to, during, and after incarceration. Self-reported ART adherence was sub-optimal, and while there were not statistically significant differences, CJ-involved women appeared to be at greatest risk of poor HIV outcomes. © 2017 Beckwith et al.

He described his impressions from the first journey in vividly written memoires published by the Krakow journal Czas. His travels inspired several genre paintings, including: Interior of a House in Biskra, Dancer from the Uled Nail Tribe, Arab Woman by a Cradle, Morning in the Sahara, Evening in the Sahara, Oasis, On the Oued Riverbank at El Kantara Oasis, and Sheik Mistress of El Kantara. At present, his works emerge at art auctions, are known from reproductions, or only from descriptions. Sandoz exhibited in Paris, Warsaw, Krakow, and Lviv, where he was appreciated by art critics.

It can also improve the assembly of fragmented genomes by proposing evolutionary-induced adjacencies between scaffolding fragments. Ancestral genes or domains are deduced from reconciled phylogenetic trees under an evolutionarymodel that considers gains, losses, speciations, duplications, and transfers as possible events for gene evolution. Reconciliations are either given as input or computed with the ecceTERA package, into which DeCoSTAR is integrated. DeCoSTAR computes adjacency evolutionary scenarios using a scoring scheme based on aweighted sum of adjacency gains and breakages. Solutions, both optimal and near-optimal, are sampled according to the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution centered around parsimonious solutions, and statistical supports on ancestral and extant adjacencies are provided.DeCoSTAR supports the features of previously contributed tools that reconstruct ancestral adjacencies, namely DeCo, DeCoLT, ART-DeCo, and DeClone. In a fewminutes, DeCoSTAR can reconstruct the evolutionary history of domains inside genes, of gene fusion and fission events, or of gene order along chromosomes, for large data sets including dozens of whole genomes from all kingdoms of life. We illustrate the potential of DeCoSTAR with several applications: ancestral reconstruction of gene orders for Anopheles mosquito genomes, multidomain proteins in Drosophila, and gene fusion and fission detection in Actinobacteria. © The Author 2017.

These changes initiated a conversation about the value of theatricality that spanned across the theater industry, and fundamentally challenged the hegemony of the realist aesthetic regime. Amidst the crescendoing discussion on theatricality, the hit Kunqu play Fifteen Strings of Cash (Shiwu guan; 1956) helped revive interest in the rich tradition of aestheticized movement. At the time of its move to the silver screen, the film world was debating how to respond to the aesthetic consequences of the clash between an actor-centered, theatrical art and an immersive, realist one. Fifteen Strings of Cash interfaced the concerns of the cinematic world with the continuously changing discourse on theatricality.

In magazines as apparently diverse as Ideal Home in the UK and Playboy in the US, a certain kind of jazz helped mark a new middlebrow connoisseurship in the 1950s and 60s. Yet rather than simply locating the style in a historical sociology of taste, this piece attempts to describe jazz's role in what was an emergent middle-class sensorium. The music's sonic characteristics were frequently called upon to complement the newly sleek visual and tactile experiences - of furniture, fabrics, plastics, the light and space of modern domestic architecture - then coming to define the aspirational bourgeois home; an international modern visual aesthetic was reflected back in jazz album cover art. But to describe experience or ambience represents a challenge to historical method. As much as history proper, then, it's through a kind of experimental criticism of both music and visual culture that this piece attempts to capture the textures and moods that jazz brought to the postwar home. © 2016 Cambridge University Press.",,,2-s2.0-85005949467

Drawing on a hitherto largely overlooked body of travellers whose work ranges across what is now Germany and Austria, the Netherlands and Dutch-speaking Belgium, the Dutch East Indies and Suriname, the contributors highlight the interrelations between the regional and the global and the role alterity plays in both spheres. They therefore offer a transnational and transcultural perspective on the ways in which the foreign was mediated to audiences back home. By combining a narrative perspective on travel writing with a socio-historically contextualised approach, essays emphasise the importance of textuality in travel literature as well as the self-positioning of such accounts in their individual historical and political environments. The first sustained analysis to focus specifically on these neighbouring cultural and linguistic areas, this collection demonstrates how topographies of knowledge were forged across these regions by an astonishingly diverse range of travelling individuals from professional scholars and writers to art dealers, soldiers, (female) explorers, and scientific collectors. The contributors address cultural, aesthetic, political, and gendered aspects of travel writing, drawing productively on other disciplines and areas of scholarly research that encompass German Studies, Low Countries Studies, comparative literature, aesthetics, the history of science, literary geography, and the history of publishing. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",,,2-s2.0-85020990700

They have a cult status in Russian history. But the battlefields had long been forgotten, and the place of Battle on the Ice is still unknown. There is a certain paradox: the memory of battles for a long time was in books, ecclesiastical texts. It was verbal, it had its visualization in the works of art, etc. But the battlefields themselves as a memory object are less important than the virtual veneration. This paradox is extremely interesting for understanding of the mechanism of formation of national historical memory. It turns out that the physical existence of the memory of the object plays a minor role, even for such seemingly obvious and important facilities like Battle of the Neva or the Battle of the Ice. The narratives, books, paintings, movies play a far greater role than the ""memory space"". It may not be monuments can be elsewhere. The story of the battle that has existed in the intellectual and cultural space of modern times, in the 19th and 21th centuries is much more rea for the nation than a genuine medieval history of the battle. The conversion of these events in the national memory of the characters, ""the mobilization of the Middle Ages"" for ideological needs is a wholly modern phenomenon.","Alexander nevsky; Battle on the ice; Historical memory; Me-morialization; Nevsky battle; Pskov",,2-s2.0-85028010727

Based on many years of collaborative work with the academician in the St. Petersburg University of the Humanities and Social Sciences and the research of the creative heritage of D.S. Likhachov, the author concludes that there is the fundamental and widespread Likhachov cultural theory, which is based on the understanding of culture as a historic developing system integrity. Likhachov culture studies is a kind of universal humanitarian knowledge covering all spheres of the human being, where each individual phenomenon reflects as a ""mirror"" the culture of the system in its unity. Dmitry Likhachov as a researcher was in line with the trends of the humanities, which inherent characteristic is cultural centrism and the need to go on the broad philosophical generalizations flowed to him from the very logic of scientific research. In this context, he interprets history as the history of culture, the cultural biography of humanity from its beginning to the formation of the masterpieces of architecture and art, philosophy and science, before the adoption of the values of individual freedom, of its moral choice and responsibility. The works of the scientist reveal the special role of the national language, that provides culture as a system integrity, and also literature, writing, that most clearly express the national ideals of culture. One of the main findings of academician on Russian culture is that it can be represented as the highest form of development of the European spirit. Dmitry Likhachov provides his own vision of globalization, that is intended by him as the contemporary process of cultural interaction on a global scale.","Complex of concepts; Cultural centrism; Cultural complex; Culture; Culture studies; D.S.

While New Caledonia was established as a penal colony in 1853, the other French islands were settled as plantation colonies in the 17th and 18th centuries. In these areas, French Creole is usually the lingua franca and has lower status than French. In New Caledonia, although French has official status and dominates in state institutions, it is the native language of only half the population. There are 28 indigenous languages and a French Creole, Tayo, spoken mostly in the rural areas. The 2014 census population revealed a multicultural New Caledonian population; it did not, however, record the rate of multilingualism in speakers. The present study, conducted in two stages, addresses a gap in the research by focussing on patterns of language use and social attitudes of New Caledonians towards their own multilingualism. The same methodology consisting of a structured questionnaire and semi-structured interview was used to collect data in both stages of the research so that a comparative analysis could be carried out between urban and rural New Caledonia. This paper focuses on social perceptions of ancestral languages and cultures as well as challenges to their preservation in multilingual spaces, as New Caledonia transitions towards a new status to be defined in an independence referendum in 2018. Preliminary results from the study show a difference in the language habits between older and younger generations of New Caledonians of Melanesian descent. Although French is perceived as the lingua franca by all, English is more valued than ancestral Melanesian languages by the younger generations. In terms of cultural representations and links with family history, there seems to be a discrepancy between the younger and the older generations. Whilst the older generations perceive the Tjibaou Cultural Centre as a traditional space for Melanesian art and culture, their younger counterparts view it as a place associated with contemporary art and music performances. © 2017 by the author(s).","English; French; Kanak; Multilingualism; New Caledonia; Sustainability",,2-s2.0-85031399151

We investigated whether dolutegravir monotherapy was non-inferior to combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) for maintaining virological suppression in patients with HIV-1 infection successfully treated with combination ART. Methods: We did this open-label, phase 2, randomised non-inferiority trial at two medical centres in the Netherlands. Eligible patients (aged ≥18 years) were on combination ART, had been virologically suppressed (HIV RNA <50 copies per mL) for at least 6 months, and had CD4 nadirs of 200 cells per μL or higher, HIV RNA zeniths of 100 000 copies per mL or less, and no history of virological failure. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), via a web-based block randomisation method (variable block sizes of 4 and 6), to switch to dolutegravir monotherapy (50 mg once a day) either immediately or after a delay of 24 weeks of continued combination ART. Randomisation was stratified by HIV RNA zenith (<50 000 copies per mL vs 50 000-99 999 copies per mL). Investigators and patients were not masked to group allocation. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with plasma HIV RNA viral loads of less than 200 copies per mL at week 24, with a non-inferiority margin of 12%. We did analyses in the on-treatment and intention-to-treat populations. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02401828. Findings: Between March 10, 2015, and Feb 4, 2016, we randomly assigned 51 patients to the immediate switch group and 53 patients to the delayed switch group. One patient who received immediate monotherapy discontinued treatment at week 12 because of disturbed sleep. At week 24, dolutegravir monotherapy was non-inferior to combination ART, with plasma HIV RNA loads of 200 copies per mL or higher observed in 2% (1/50) of patients in the immediate switch group and in no patients in the delayed switch group (difference 2%, 95% CI -5 to 12). Of patients assigned to the delayed switch group, 47 (89%) switched to dolutegravir monotherapy at week 24, two (4%) of whom subsequently discontinued monotherapy because of headache (n=1) and disturbed sleep (n=1). Eight (8%) of the 95 patients who remained on dolutegravir monotherapy had virological failure; all had therapeutic plasma concentrations of dolutegravir. In three (38%) of the eight patients, mutations associated with resistance were detected in the integrase gene. According to a predefined stopping rule, detection of these mutations led to premature study discontinuation. Interpretation: Dolutegravir monotherapy was non-inferior to combination ART at 24 weeks. However, virological failure continued to occur thereafter and led to dolutegravir resistance. Dolutegravir should not be used as maintenance monotherapy.

It took H. erectus, physically endowed hunters, at least another million years before signs of ritual burial appeared with Homo Heidelbergensis. Not until about 160,000 years-ago does evidence for incipient art emerge. While records of farming emerge 23,000 years ago, it is only 12,000 years ago that more extensive agriculture is recorded in Middle East river valleys. With new food resources and wealth the human mind turned from camp-fire rituals to the construction of monuments for the dead and to mass killings named “war”, which dominate the history of civilization. From wars motivated by a need for resources deadly conflicts under a myriad of false flags have become an end for itself, including the most bizarre forms of blood rituals and torture. Since the industrial age with the development of new weapons for industrial-scale killing, and since the splitting of the atom, “war” has become a form of mass suicide threatening to destroy civilization and much of nature, leading to the 7th mass extinction of species.

Merezhkovsky's December 14(1918), M.M. Prishvin's diary of 1918 and a number of articles of the collection Iz glubiny [From the Depth] (1918), on the one hand, and T.N. Tolstaya's Kys (2000), P.V. Krusanov's A Bite of Angel (2000), O.A. Slavnikova's 2017(2006), on the other, the author of the article considers the changes occurring in the topic of Russian literature from the era of the revolution of 1917 to the turn of the 21st c. The historical-typological and hermeneutic methods, conceptual (constantological) and mythopoetic approaches, the study of the history of creative works are used. It is shown that the historiosophical neomythology of Merezhkovsky in December 14, written tight after the revolutionary events in Russia, was reduced to the necessity of dis-identification of the Russian ""land"" and the ""Beast-people"" that betrayed it. Similar thoughts are found in a number of works by his contemporaries. On the background of the 1000-year tradition of identifying the ""land"" and its people in Russian literature and culture, relying on the Bible, Byzantine literature and folklore, the deconstruction of the concept ""Russian people"" led to the creation of a neo-myth about the posthuman on the former Russian land. Russian postmodernism thought of itself as of a direct continuation of the culture of the Silver Age. The author shows how Merezhkovsky's neo-mythologem about the sparation of ""land"" and people outlined in December 14 in the genre coordinates of dystopia and alternative history spread on to the Russian art prose of the turn of the 21st c. In the novel Kys there are mutants that appeared on the territory of the former Moscow as a result of a nuclear explosion, usual humanistic norms are inapplicable to them. Tolstaya turns the concept ""people"" into a simulacrum: neither ""old"" nor ""duckies"" are ""God-bearers""; they are not even a ""cultural-historical community"". A potential post-human in the dystopian novel is a mutant Benedict, protesting against the binary opposition of ""mouse"" and ""cat"" (""kys""), traditional for the Russian society. A Bite of Angel tells the story of the Empire of ""mogs"" as a tool of total destruction of the ""rotten"" world, the result of which should be ""Iriy"" - a ""heaven on earth"" without people on the territory of the former Russia. The Sacred Emperor Ivan the Plague, having survived the ""bite of angel"", became a creature of inhuman nature. To achieve his purpose, he chose, in terms of Merezhkovsky, the path of the ""Beast"": not love, but fear leading to obedience. The 100-year results of the revolution of 1917 in the novel 2017 testify to the essential ""nonauthenticity"" of this event and of all Russian civilization of the 20th c. Only archaic-mythological archetypes, embodied in nature (""land""), and mythological creatures that nature makes have an ontological status; their emanation is certain individuals. So, the author proves the stability of the shift in the literary topic under the pressure of the revolutionary events of 1917-1918; it can be explained not only by the unique history of Russia in the 20th c., but also by the global process of massivization of historical peoples as well as globalization with its gradually weakening link between ""lands"" and their peoples.","D.S.

The author gives priority to the analysis of the subject forms: the relationship of the storyteller and the historical person and also an internal distance between them. The author of the article comes to a conclusion that Solzhenitsyn involves the sphere of psychophysiology of a person to penetrate into an essence of the hero's character: memory, emotions, correlation between psychological parameters of behavior and acts. The writer uses verbal and art means: non-personal direct (half-reported) speech, rhythm, the italics, discharge; intonation components: exclamatory and interrogative sentences, rhetorical questions.

This deficiency can be eliminated by introducing rocking wall system. Previously studied rocking wall systems usually have the rocking wall situated outside the frame, which results in some challenges and inconvenience. In the study, a novel infilled rocking wall frame (IRWF) system is proposed, which uses infilled RC wall to create a rocking wall within the RC frame. To evaluate seismic performance of the proposed system, both an IRWF model and an RC frame (RCF) model were designed according to Chinese seismic design code. Time history analysis and incremental dynamic analysis were conducted to compare both systems. The results show that IRWF system has more uniform drift and higher collapse margin ratio compared to the RCF system. Economic evaluation of IRWF system was investigated using the state-of-the-art ATC-58 performance-based assessment methodology. The result shows superior performance of the IRWF system. The annualized loss of the IRWF model is about 28% less than the RCF model. This shows IRWF system is a viable and efficient alternative resilient seismic force resisting system. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Economic loss; Incremental dynamic analysis; Infilled rocking wall frame; Performance-based evaluation; Reinforced concrete frame; Seismic performance","Concretes; Dynamic analysis; Economic analysis; Losses; Prestressed materials; Reinforced concrete; Reinforcement; Seismic design; Seismic waves; Seismology; Structural frames; Economic loss; Incremental dynamic analysis; Performance based evaluations; Reinforced concrete frames; Rocking wall; Seismic Performance; Structural design",2-s2.0-85023604538

Some studies show that it plays a preventive role in the occurrence of PTB, while others suggest it is ineffective. Objectives: Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of CC in preventing PTB and negative neonatal outcome (e.g., respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and birth weight) based on a new statistical framework: multilevel analysis and propensity score matching (PSM) in twin pregnancies. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the maternity wards of three general and teaching hospitals in Tehran, Iran, during January 2014 to February 2015. Using stratified random sampling with the proportional allocation method, twin pregnancies were randomly selected from the medical files list. Of 431 eligible individuals, 31 patients underwent CC as a result of CI, and the others had healthy cervixes and no CC. Next, variables that confound the relationships between CC and PTB (e.g., assisted reproductive technology (ART), preterm rupture of membrane (PROM), nulliparous, history of abortion, and mother’s age) by applying 1:2 PSM were matched in both groups. The CC group was considered the case group and, based on PSM, 61 patients, whose characteristics were similar to the CC group, were selected from 400 healthy mothers as a control group. For considering twins dependencies, multilevel modeling was used, and prevalence of PTB, LBW, and RDS, as well as mean gestational age in the two groups, were compared. Results: The standardized mean difference (SMD) shows that the distribution of confounding variables in the propensity-matched data is the same in both groups. Results revealed that, although gestational age in the case group was significantly less than the control group, the prevalence of PTB in case and control was not significantly different (P = 0.190). The prevalence of neonatal outcome of RDS and LBW in the case and control groups was not significant (P > 0.05). Conclusions: It appears that CC has an effective role in prevention of PTB, LBW, and RDS, because their prevalence in both groups was the same. However, drawing a clear conclusion regarding its role requires more research with a random clinical trial (RCT) design. © 2016, Iranian Red Crescent Medical Journal.","Cervical cerclage; Cervical incompetence; Multilevel modeling; Propensity score; Twin pregnancies",,2-s2.0-85027405149

(2011). Creole talk. The poetics and politics of Argentine verbal art. In R. Baron & A.C. Cara (eds.), Creolization as cultural creativity (pp. 198-227). Jackson: University Press of Mississippi). Linguistic creativity doesn't have to be playful and amusing; it can also be about experiences of marginalization, injustice and pain. There are, consequently, different creativities and different indexicalities of creatively manipulated speech. In this article, the focus is on noisy, nonsensical, sometimes unsettling performances of linguistic creativity and on their contexts. These are only slightly different from those Cara refers to - sociolinguistic settings of inequality, based on a history of experiences of othering and subjugation among women in a small northeastern Nigerian village. The artful unmaking of words and meaning that is in the center of this contribution addresses reality in a variety of ways: it aims at evoking ideas and memories of what cannot always be seen and heard (such as spirits), of a performer's feelings of otherness.Noisy and messy communicative practice such as 'gibberish', screaming and swearing need to be seen, I argue, as performances rather than as deviations from 'proper linguistic practice'. They might digress from certain norms, but nevertheless remain interpersonal in their communicative design; they are powerful yet individual and original attempts to reach out to the other, in order to say something which might otherwise not be said. The noisy and unintelligible in language can be an attempt to retrieve what has been discarded and to put the marginal into the center. It is art that intents to remind audiences of the powers of horror, disgust, and ugliness. In practices that highlight linguistic creativity, a particularly radical way of transforming language into such abject art is to make speech (at least initially) incomprehensible, to work with obscurity, noise and disruption. The strategies used in these pieces of art are diverse: utterances are interrupted by made-up speech, and spoken text turns into sung, screamed or murmured text; noise is presented as that what belongs to the Other, and audiences are left with the task not just of listening and evaluating these performances, but also with the task of decoding them. However, noise bears in it the potential of rejection: audiences have to power to decide whether they accept, after all, the invitation to decode whatever meaning the sound of a voice may have. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.","Gendered speech; Jukun; Nigeria; Noise; Unintelligibility; Voice",,2-s2.0-85021854111

In the past centuries, architecture was pioneer art which has special features such as; simplicity, organization, clear style, accurate decoration, material assembly, and so on. However, modern buildings become complex products that have so many parts which have to fulfil different functions. Therefore, new computational ways and techniques have been developed to facilitate the design of modern complicated buildings and to create a convenient quantitative relationship between the environment and the envelope, putting into consideration the obstacles which influence on the building design. This has therefore formed the concept of parametric design in architecture, in order to deal with complex designs and gain more accurate results. Modern architects claim that parametric design is the most creative way to understand the development and complexity of the new era of architectural trends [1]. Meanwhile, it is really hard to deal with sophisticated details in buildings using our brains to imagine, or conventional ways to design [2]. In addition, building technologies nowadays are integrated and containing many disciplines in the same time, and each discipline is dependent on the other disciplines in a very complex vast connections. Hence, they should be organized in a database container, and this container could be managed parametrically using parametric design as an advanced way to explore and understand these sophisticated relations [3]. This paper hence presents a literature review on parametric design in architecture practice and put a focus on its applications in daylighting and solar radiation, which can have an essential impact on improving daylight availability and energy saving. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Daylighting; Energy saving; Parametric design; Solar radiation","Architecture; Availability; Buildings; Containers; Daylighting; Energy conservation; Solar radiation; Architecture practice; Building technologies; Computational ways; Daylight availability; Environmental conditions; Literature reviews; Modern buildings; Parametric design; Architectural design",2-s2.0-85012085312

The tropical karstic region of Lagoa Santa, in central Brazil (state of Minas Gerais) is one of the richest bioanthropological records available to study the behaviors and funerary practices of early Holocene South Americans, with more than 200 skeletons found so far. One of the key locations to examine the history of human settlement in Lagoa Santa is the site of Lapa do Santo, a rockshelter known to contain the oldest rock art and the earliest evidence of funerary complexity in the continent. In this geoarchaeological investigation we focus on the early Holocene settlement at Lapa do Santo (7.9–12.7 cal kyBP) applying high-resolution geoarchaeological techniques, such as micromorphology, organic petrology and μFTIR, on both archaeological, modern reference and experimental samples. This is the first time that a micro-contextual approach integrated with experimental geoarchaeology has been applied to study the formation of rockshelter deposits in a tropical setting. Our results show that the stratigraphic sequence formed under the dual influence of anthropogenic sedimentation—through continuous combustion activities—and geogenic sedimentation in the form of oxisol aggregates which fell from above the limestone cliff into the rockshelter. Intact hearths and remobilized combustion debris, possibly hearth rake-out, are close to the graves suggesting repeated burning activities as part of the ritual behavior of early Holocene South Americans. Large amounts of ash are intermixed with heated and unheated oxisol aggregates. Heated termite mound fragments were also found mixed within the sediments. Post-depositional alteration of the site includes limited bioturbation and localized, low energy surface water and sub-surface concentrations of moisture, leading to precipitation of dense, secondary carbonates. The age inversions can be attributed to the human action of reworking the ashy sediments and not to post-abandonment processes. Despite this, the overall preservation of the sediments is good and most human burials can be considered to be in primary context. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Experimental hearths; Lagoa Santa; Micromorphology; Organic petrology; Paleoamerican; Tropical geoarchaeology; μFTIR","archaeology; FTIR spectroscopy; Holocene; human settlement; karst; micromorphology; petrology; Brazil; Lagoa Santa; Minas Gerais; Isoptera",2-s2.0-84979713565

I consider landscape as a complex process in which human beings (with their history and culture) and their environment are mutually defined. On the basis of this approach to landscape studies, and by considering contemporary documents on landscape (i.e. the European Landscape Convention, the Latin American Initiative for Landscape and the UNESCO Florence Declaration) I analyse the similarity between the notion of landscape and the concepts of common good, the management of commons and the commons pool resources institutions. Through theoretical research supported by practical examples (e.g. community gardens) I argue that landscape can be defined as a common good, can include the commons, and the collective management of lands and common pool resources institutions. The paper relies on an excursus through the theories and legal documents, with a specific regard to the theoretical foundations of these different notions. The analysis carried out in the paper leads, in the end, to the possibility of defining the ‘right to landscape’. Even if the concept is new in the literature, and a right to landscape is not recognised as a right per se, it is already implicated and studied in many international rights laws. Three approaches to landscape as a right have been distinguished: the right to landscape as a perceived landscape (a collective right), as a right to the environment and a right for addressing human rights. I integrated these approaches by arguing that landscape is a domain in relation to which human rights can be claimed, and that landscape can be considered as a right to which human beings are entitled. © 2017, Igitur, Utrecht Publishing and Archiving Services.

Objective Our aim was to explore the prevalence of HIV and its association with psychiatric co-morbidities. Design, setting and participants All patients with a recorded diagnosis of HIV (any position of the ICD–10 codes B20–B24) were identified during the period 2007–2014 and related to the total population in Stockholm by January 1, 2015, N = 2.21 million. The age at diagnosis, gender, and first occurrence of an HIV diagnosis was recorded. Analyses were done by age and gender. Prevalence of psychiatric co-morbidities amongst HIV patients were recorded. Main outcome measures Age-adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated with logistic regression for prevalent psychiatric co-morbidities in HIV infected individuals compared to the prevalence in the general population. Results The total prevalence of HIV was 0.16%; females 0.10% (n = 1134) and males 0.21% (n = 2448). HIV-infected people were more frequently diagnosed with psychiatric illnesses and drug abuse. In females and males with HIV-diagnosis respectively, drug dependence disorder was 7.5 (7.76% vs 1.04%) and 5.1 (10.17% vs 1.98%) times higher, psychotic disorders were 6.3 (2.65% vs 0.42%) and 2.9 (1.43% vs 0.49%) times higher, bipolar disorder was 2.5 (1.41% vs 0.57%) and 3 (1.02% vs 0.34%) times higher, depression diagnosis was 1.5 (8.47% vs 5.82%) and 3.4 (10.17% vs 2.97%) higher, trauma-related disorder was 1.5 (6.00% vs 4.10%) respectively 2.9 (4.45% vs 1.56%) times higher, anxiety disorder was 1.2 (6.88% vs 5.72%) and 2.2 (6.54% vs 2.93%) times higher than in their non-infected peers.

Its ancient monuments have been the model for innumerable buildings and works of art all over the Western world. However, the reality of modern Athens is much more complicated: the ancient monuments and neo-classical buildings are interlaced with winding streets, Byzantine churches, mosques, and an oriental bazaar. These juxtapositions require explanation. This book explores the development of the city of Athens after the beginning of Greek independence in 1830. It presents the process of creation of a neo-classical capital, in the place of a pre-existing town with the remains of a long history. An array of chapters examine the treatment of the pre-revolutionary town; its connection with the neo-classical city; the position of old churches in this antiquity-centred capital; and the factors that influenced the implementation of the projects for the new capital and their consequences for the city’s evolution.

The research of bias flow liners has a fairly long history concerning both the parameter dependencies as well as the methods to model the acoustic behaviour of bias flow liners under the variety of different bias and grazing flow conditions. In order to establish an overview over the state of the art, this paper provides a comprehensive review about the published research on bias flow liners and modelling approaches with an extensive study of the most relevant parameters determining the acoustic behaviour of these liners. The paper starts with a historical description of available investigations aiming on the characterization of the bias flow absorption principle. This chronological compendium is extended by the recent and ongoing developments in this field. In a next step the fundamental acoustic property of bias flow liner in terms of the wall impedance is introduced and the different derivations and formulations of this impedance yielding the different published model descriptions are explained and compared. Finally, a parametric study reveals the most relevant parameters for the acoustic damping behaviour of bias flow liners and how this is reflected by the various model representations. Although the general trend of the investigated acoustic behaviour is captured by the different models fairly well for a certain range of parameters, in the transition region between the resonance dominated and the purely bias flow related regime all models lack the correct damping prediction. This seems to be connected to the proper implementation of the reactance as a function of bias flow Mach number. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bias flow; Combustion instability; Liner; Sound absorption","Acoustic properties; Acoustic wave absorption; Aircraft engines; Combustion; Combustors; Damping; Gas turbines; Sound insulating materials; Bias flow; Combustion instabilities; Gas turbine combustor; Liner; Low-emission combustions; Model representation; Parameter dependency; Sound absorption; Acoustic impedance",2-s2.0-85019198344

Design Prospective cohort study of data collected at baseline, 3 and 6 months from HIV-infected patients with a history of injection drug use who were not treated with anti-retroviral therapy. Participants were recruited between 2012–2014 from a narcology (addiction) hospital in St. Petersburg, Russia. Methods Fatal overdose was determined based on contact reports to study staff in the year after discharge. Non-fatal overdose was self-reported at the 3- and 6-month assessments. The main independent variable for HIV severity was CD4 cell count at the baseline interview (&lt;200 cells/mm3 ≥ 200 cells/mm3). Secondary analyses assessed time since HIV diagnosis and treated with anti-retroviral treatment (ART) prior to enrolment as independent variables. We fit Cox proportional hazards models to assess whether HIV severity is associated with either fatal or non-fatal overdose. Results Among 349 narcology patients, 18 participants died from overdose within one year after discharge (8.7%, 95% CI 3.4–14.2 by Kaplan–Meier); an estimated 51% [95% CI 34–68%] reported at least one non-fatal overdose within 6 months of discharge.

As such, scholars from a wide range of fields have taken great interest in the role that subsistence has played in both human cultural and biological evolution. Central to this discussion is the diet composition and nutrition of contemporary hunters and gatherers, who are frequently conscripted as model populations for ancestral human nutrition. Research among the world's few remaining foraging populations is experiencing a resurgence, as they are making the final transition away from diets composed of wild foods, to those dominated by domesticated cultigens and/or processed foods. In an effort to glean as much information as possible, before such populations are no longer hunting and gathering, researchers interested in the evolution of human nutrition are rapidly collecting and accessing new and more data.

I will focus on the multiplicity of meanings of the nymph in the Classical world, from the religious to the erotic, and the resonances of her image in 19th century Britain in the form of female nude paintings exhibited within the specific social context of attitudes towards female art models, prostitution and pornography. I will look at nude paintings of Classical nymphs as a way of accessing hidden sexual discourses and examine to what extent paintings of nymphs were also paintings of nymphomaniacs. © 2017 Journal of International Women's Studies.","Classical reception studies; Medical humanities; Sexuality",,2-s2.0-85013287756

It often involves the peritoneum, but also thoracic cases have been reported. The aim of the present review is to describe the demographic, clinical, radiological, and pathological features of such a rare variant of thoracic mesothelioma, and the state of the art regarding the therapeutic approaches currently available. Data source: English-language articles published from 1985 to June 2016, and related to thoracic deciduoid mesothelioma cases were retrieved using the Pubmed database. Study selection: The search terms were ""mesothelioma,"" ""thoracic mesothelioma,"" ""epithelial mesothelioma,"" ""pleural mesothelioma,"" and ""deciduoid mesothelioma."" Results: Forty-four cases included in 16 articles, published in the period under investigation, were analyzed in detail. Conclusions: The mean age of the patients was 63 years, and the male to female ratio 1.7:1. Approximately 58% had exposure to asbestos, and 73% had a smoking history; familiarity was rarely reported. The most common anatomical site of origin was the right pleura, and the most frequent clinical manifestations were chest pain, dyspnea, cough, and weight loss. Thoracic X-ray and computed tomography were the imaging techniques most employed for diagnosis and surgical planning. The pathological diagnosis was obtained by examination of surgical or biopsy specimens in most cases. The best treatment strategy of deciduoid mesothelioma is a matter of debate; nevertheless a multidisciplinary approach is currently the best option for the choice of the adequate therapeutic scheme. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Cancer; Deciduoid; Mesothelioma; Pleura; Thorax",,2-s2.0-85008507454

Objective: To assess the TB incidence in HIV-infected adults and its associated risk factors. Method: A cohort study with retrospective review of medical records and prospective follow-up of HIV-infected adult participants attending CTC who were 18-55 years old, had CD4 count more than 250 cells/mm3 in the period of 2008-2010 and were not on ART at enrolment. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to explore the predictors of incident TB. Results: Overall 777 (24%) of 3,279 CTC enrolled HIV-infected adults fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the study. The incidence of TB in the study population ranged from 0.8/100 per person years (PY) at risk (95% CI 0.5-1.3) in the main analysis to 1.7/100 PY at risk (95% CI 1.0-2.6) in sensitivity analyses. Only prior history of TB disease was found to have a significant association with an increased risk of TB, hazard ratio 5.7 (95% CI 2.0-16.4, p value 0.001).

In order to analyze such interaction mechanisms and to obtain the interface parameters required for the design of earth structures reinforced with geosynthetics, laboratory tests have to be carried out by means of large pullout apparatus. In the paper, some of the factors that may affect pullout test results are widely discussed, specifically those related to the characteristics of apparatus, as well as to the test rate and the width of the geosynthetic specimen. Afterwards, the main experimental results of pullout tests carried out by the authors on geogrids embedded in compacted granular soils are expressed in terms of both pullout resistance and apparent coefficient of friction at the soilgeosynthetic interface, studying the influence of different parameters under monotonic and cyclic loading conditions (vertical effective stress, reinforcement length, cyclic loading history).

The key challenge lies in the fact that the optimal solution of a DOP typically changes over time. This paper focuses on using query-based learning dynamic particle swarm optimization (QBLDPSO) to solve DOPs. QBLDPSO is mainly used for improving multi-population-based PSO; our QBL mechanism includes two learning strategies that integrate the concepts of diversity and memory into PSO. The first learning strategy, QBL quantum parameter adaptation (QBLQPA), is used to apply the concept of diversity to the multi-population based algorithm. This is different from typical diversity-based PSO approaches, which passively maintain the diversity of particles in the solution space. We actively adapt the ratio of quantum particles and neutral particles to achieve diversity without analyzing the distribution of optima in the solution space. The second learning strategy is query-based learning optima prediction (QBLOP). Although QBLOP exploits the concept of memory, we do not need to analyze the history of all particles. We select the k nearest particles to the current best solution and use a minimum encompassing circle as the possible prediction region. Our experimental results are based on the generalized dynamic benchmark generator (GDBG), which is adopted as a benchmark for the DOP. The proposed method outperforms two state-of-the-art multi-population-based PSO methods with the average improvements of 11.37% and 8% using QBLQPA. In particular, for the recurrent problems in GDBG, our method improves performance by 35.06%. © 2017 IEEE.","dynamic optimization; optima prediction; Particle swarm optimization; quantum parameter adaptation; query-based learning","Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; Learning systems; Optimization; Swarm intelligence; Dynamic optimization; Dynamic optimization problem (DOP); Learning strategy; Neutral particles; Optimal solutions; Quantum parameters; Quantum particles; query-based learning; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",2-s2.0-85028326791

The Seville school of gunners was established by the Spanish monarchy in the last quarter of the sixteenth century with the purpose of providing the Carrera de Indias—the transatlantic fleets—with technicians capable of using cannons. Changing the scale of apprenticeship, every year this innovative institution trained dozens of seamen, soldiers, and craftsmen in the art of gunnery. Intertwining theoretical lessons and training sessions on a practice ground, the teaching program was completed by a formal “examination” of the candidates with questions. The study of this school, one of many which existed not only in the territories of the Spanish monarchy but also in England and in Venice, reveals how, at the dawn of the “scientific revolution,” skills of technicians could progressively merge with more formalized knowledge. ©2017 by the Society for the History of Technology.

Three of the most fundamental innovations in the history of life were the appearance of the first cells, the evolution of multi-cellularity and the evolution of animals. The MOFAOTYOF principle (my oldest fossils are older than your oldest fossils) commonly clouds discussions around the oldest fossil evidence, requiring a rigorous and critical approach to determining which fossils are reliable and should form the basis of our understanding of early life. In addition, evidence for early fossils must be considered within their spatial context; we need to understand the conditions under which they were preserved and how they were preserved. This book summarizes recent progress in the fields of: (1) the cellular preservation of early microbial life; and (2) the early evolution of macroscopic animal life, including the Ediacaran biota. Deciphering the evidence for early life requires some degree of exceptional preservation, employment of state-of-the-art techniques and also an understanding gleaned from Phanerozoic lagerstätte and modern analogues.

Underground utilities are critical infrastructure for all modern cities. They carry drinking water, storm water, sewage, natural gas, electric power, telecommunications, steam, etc. In most cities, the underground infrastructure reflects the growth and history of the city. Many components are aging, in unknown locations with congested configurations, and in unknown condition. The technique uses sensing and information technology to determine the state of infrastructure and provide it in an appropriate, timely and secure format for managers, planners and users. The sensors include ground penetrating radar and buried sensors for persistent sensing of localized conditions. Signal processing and pattern recognition techniques convert the data in information-laden databases for use in analytics, graphical presentations, metering and planning. The presented data are from construction of the St. Paul St. CCTA Bus Station Project in Burlington, VT; utility replacement sites in Winooski, VT; and laboratory tests of smart phone position registration and magnetic signaling. The soil conditions encountered are favorable for GPR sensing and make it possible to locate buried pipes and soil layers. The present state of the art is that the data collection and processing procedures are manual and somewhat tedious, but that solutions for automating these procedures appear to be viable. Magnetic signaling with moving permanent magnets has the potential for sending lowfrequency telemetry signals through soils that are largely impenetrable by other electromagnetic waves. © 2017 SPIE.","ground penetrating radar; mapping; smart cities; underground infrastructure; water supply","Data handling; Electromagnetic waves; Geological surveys; Ground penetrating radar systems; Mapping; Pattern recognition; Potable water; Radar; Sewage; Signal processing; Smartphones; Soils; Water supply; Condition assessments; Graphical presentations; Ground Penetrating Radar; Pattern recognition techniques; Processing procedures; Replacement sites; Underground infrastructure; Underground utilities; Smart city",2-s2.0-85029903459

This highlights the importance of a geographical area corresponding to present-day Belgium and the southern regions of Belgium, with Metz as centre, where Bishop Chrodegang played a leading role. For centuries all chant was performed using memory alone, for there was no musical notation. The ninth century will see the development of neumes, as simple memory aids, like tropes. Only in the eleventh century, especially with Guido d’Arezzo, will the designation of notes and writing on staff lines appear. Only then can one sing what one reads. This study then focuses on the Benedictine monastery of St Trond where musical annotation was introduced at the end of the eleventh century by Rudolph of St Trond. The question is how Gregorian chant was performed at St Trond. One cannot avoid the question of the possible contrasts between the beauty of the liturgical chant and the many troubles that gripped the abbey at the time. A question valid for the eleventh century: a question of contrast valid for our time.

I saw the piece, Destruction, in the American Realness Festival at Abrons Art Center in New York City in January 2016. During the seventy-minute-long performance, the countertenor sang and played the piano, and appeared in mediated form in a complexly assembled film montage. In both live and filmed form his performance was a labor to resurrect the dead into an insurrectionist revolt, an army of all the black people whose lives have been taken - from slavery to lynchings, to incarceration, to police shootings. The lush, sometimes heart-stopping sound environment was both live and recorded, a mix, mash-up, and collage of sounds and sources the core of which was Lamar's singing of fragments of slave spirituals. In what follows, I am prompted by Lamar's work to explore my own ongoing commitment to Marx through what I read as the work's temporal innovations. These innovations, I suggest, supplement Marx's failure to imagine a revolutionary strategy through anything but the standard progressivist notion of time and history.

Results: By this time, cataract surgery has advanced to the point that Kelman's introduction of phacoemulsification and use of intraocular lenses (IOLs), both very controversial when initially introduced, have become state of the art. Outpatient surgery, minimally limited mobility, sutureless incisions, and topical anesthesia also have become key components of standard treatment. The author envisions availability of medications for nuclear sclerosis and presbyopia, expansion of lens surgery for refractive purposes with postsurgical adjustment and unprecedented precision, increased mechanization of lens removal with emphasis on uncomplicated surgery rather than refractive precision, and accommodating IOLs all becoming standard.

Very little research has been conducted for many years with the ""aquatic phycomycetes"", possibly because in general these microorganisms are often hard to isolate and maintain in most laboratory facilities, little background data has been available to identify the species, the studies were time consuming, the state of the art technology in many cases did not permit studies on these groups and they were thought to be economically and ecologically unimportant. However, this perception has changed recently. For example, some of these species (1) are now known to play important roles in biomass conversion and sequestration of CO2, (2) are parasites of many fungal, plant and animal species, (3) may harbor genes of important enzymes for industrial applications and (4) can serve as indicator species for eco-tox monitoring.

SUMMARY ANSWER: There was no increase in the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes of PTB, and LBW following PGD compared with autologous IVF. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Pregnancies resulting from ART are associated with a higher risk of pregnancy complications compared with spontaneously conceived pregnancies. The possible reason of adverse obstetric outcomes following ART has been attributed to the underlying infertility itself and embryo specific epigenetic modifications due to the IVF techniques. It is of interest whether interventions such as embryo biopsy as performed in PGD affect perinatal outcomes. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Anonymous data were obtained from the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority (HFEA), the statutory regulator of ART in the UK. The HFEA has collected data prospectively on all ART performed in the UK since 1991. Data from 1996 to 2011 involving a total of 88 010 singleton live births were analysed including 87 571 following autologous stimulated IVF ± ICSI and 439 following PGD cycles. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Data on all women undergoing either a stimulated fresh IVF ± ICSI treatment cycle or a PGD cycle during the period from 1996 to 2011 were analysed to compare perinatal outcomes of PTB and LBW among singleton live births. Logistic regression analysis was performed adjusting for female age category, year of treatment, previous IVF cycles, infertility diagnosis, number of oocytes retrieved, whether IVF or ICSI was used and day of embryo transfer. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: There was no increase in the risk of PTB and LBW following PGD versus autologous stimulated IVF ± ICSI treatment, unadjusted odds of PTB (odds ratio (OR) 0.68, 95% CI: 0.46-0.99) and LBW (OR 0.56, 95% CI: 0.37-0.85). After adjusting for the potential confounders, there was again no increase in the risk of the adverse perinatal outcomes following PGD: PTB (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.66, 95% CI: 0.45-0.98) and LBW (aOR0.58, 95% CI: 0.38-0.88). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Although the analysis was adjusted for a number of important confounders, the data set had no information on confounders such as smoking, body mass index and the medical history of women during pregnancy to allow adjustment. There was no information on the stage of embryo at biopsy, whether blastomere ortrophectoderm biopsy. WIDER IMPLICATIONS FOR THE FINDINGS: The demonstration that PGD is not associated with higher risk of PTB and LBW provides reassurance towards its current expanding application. © The Author 2016.

Each object has its history -A specific story to tell. Often this history can significantly increase the relevance of the artifact. The provenance of one rather small collection of African artifacts in the archive of the Weltmuseum Wien is especially fascinating. It is attributed to the West-African Ashanti, an ethnic group native to an area in modern day Ghana, and entered the collection of the museum in the late 1890s. The group of 27 artifacts (Inv. Nr. 58.373 - Inv. Nr. 58.399) includes 7 spearheads, 1 knife, 3 wooden spoons, 6 gourd bowls, 4 pairs leather sandals, 1 drum, 3 harp-lutes and 1 oware game board. The distinction of this collection lies in its origin: it was brought to Europe by Africans, rather than collected in Africa by Europeans. These Africans were part of ethnographical expositions widespread around the turn of the 19th century called human zoos. Human zoos were organized and managed most commonly by European or American businessmen who recruited ""exotic"" people from all around the world. These performances toured Europe and the US and were advertised as ""authentic"", but in fact were tailored to satisfy the racist stereotypes of Western audiences. These expositions spanned from 1870 to 1940. The difference between human zoos and other human expositions (e.g. freak shows) was the focus on cultural and ethnographic aspects. Promoters presented human zoos as scientific and educational. In order to guarantee ""authenticity"", promoters and entrepreneurs often closely cooperated with scientists and museums. A scientist or official, after examining the members of a human zoo and/or viewing a special private performance would publish articles attesting the authenticity and scientific value of the human zoo. The artifacts from the Weltmuseum Wien came from an ""Ashanti"" human zoo that performed in the ""Tiergarten am Schuttel"" -A zoo in the Viennese Prater that was closed in 1901. The collection was given to the predecessor of the Weltmuseum Wien in 1897 by the management of the zoo and originates from the ""Aschanti-Dorf"" human zoo that performed there from July to October 1896. The ""Aschanti-Dorf"" was very successful and had a large impact on Viennese culture - leaving traces in music, art and theater. Although they were very widespread and very popular, human zoos received little scholarly attention for many decades. Since the late 1980s academic research of the topic has begun and the stories of the several thousand exhibited people has started to being rediscovered and remembered. Thus, this collection of the Weltmuseum Wien is a small but important piece in the puzzle of the history of human zoos.",,,2-s2.0-85021352967

This dichotomy is present on all levels of writing and poeticism of Marguerite Duras - from the topics to her narration, rhetoric, and style, as well as her multi-layered metaphors. The starting point of her artistic, ""feminine"" poetic writing (écriture) is a different, reciprocal relationship between the body (senses, emotions) and language, imaginary and symbolical, image and word, the literal meaning and the figurative one - in the text. All this is manifested in her lyrical, avantgarde opus, modern and anti-modern at the same time, at the intersection of prose and poetry, as well as in her experimental, newwave cinema of the 1960s and 1970s. At the core of her ""poeticism of desire"" there is a dichotomy of opposition, as well as exchange between sensuousness and knowledge, love and pain. The key of that poeticism is the fusion and interaction of antinomies, which nevertheless persist as differences (male-female, East-West, passion and melancholy, ""life"" and ""art). ""Feminine"" desire is transformed into a gesture of inner exile and the subject's subversion of historical determinism, the authoritarianism of social power and ratio. The motifs of erotic passion and love are combined with the pain of forgetting and the pain of remembering. Her writing is a semioticized interpretation of experience, a relationship between the unconscious and language. Desire and passion as the most powerful élan vital are antipodes to depression and the feeling of contingency. Desire and anxiety are the two extremes of this liminal, paradoxical writing of ""female difference"" (border writing). In between corporality and semiotics, personal and gender history - love and writing, ethic and philosophy, poeticism and language function as mutual metaphors.","""Feminine writing""; Desire; Melancholy; Passion; Poeticism of transition",,2-s2.0-85026923050

Recently, several computer-aided photo-matching algorithms have been developed to more efficiently match images of unique individuals in databases with thousands of images. However, the identification accuracy of these algorithms can severely bias estimates of vital rates and population size. Therefore, it is important to understand the performance and limitations of state-of-the-art photo-matching algorithms prior to implementation in capture–recapture studies involving possibly thousands of images. Here, we compared the performance of four photo-matching algorithms; Wild-ID, I3S Pattern+, APHIS, and AmphIdent using multiple amphibian databases of varying image quality. We measured the performance of each algorithm and evaluated the performance in relation to database size and the number of matching images in the database. We found that algorithm performance differed greatly by algorithm and image database, with recognition rates ranging from 100% to 22.6% when limiting the review to the 10 highest ranking images. We found that recognition rate degraded marginally with increased database size and could be improved considerably with a higher number of matching images in the database. In our study, the pixel-based algorithm of AmphIdent exhibited superior recognition rates compared to the other approaches. We recommend carefully evaluating algorithm performance prior to using it to match a complete database. By choosing a suitable matching algorithm, databases of sizes that are unfeasible to match “by eye” can be easily translated to accurate individual capture histories necessary for robust demographic estimates. © 2017 The Authors.

Over and over, such inventories of spectacular man made constructions have been rewritten, re-edited and reimagined. Both the wonders and the lists of wonders, preferably of the seven, have had a profound and long-lasting effect, and have been abundantly imitated, copied and reworked. Renaissance creative thinking was obsessed with the seven wonders of the ancient world, and early-modern Europe experienced a surge of visual and verbal depictions of wonders. This article is about a remarkable list of seven wonders, included in one of Joachim Du Bellay's canonical poems on Roman antiquities (Antiquités de Rome), published in Paris in 1558. Du Bellay shapes his list of wonders by exploring patterns of both repetition and mutability. Almost imperceptibly, he starts suggesting connections between 16th-century Rome and distant civilizations. Through the eyes of a fictive traveller and collector, the poet venerates the greatness and laments the loss of ancient buildings, sites and works of art, slowly developing a verbal, visual and open-ended gallery, creating a collection of crumbling or vanished, mainly Roman, architecture. This poetic display of ruins and dust in the Eternal City is nourished by the attraction of the inevitable destruction of past splendour and beauty. In the sonnets, Du Bellay imitates classical models and patterns. While compiling powerful images and stories of destruction, he combines techniques associated with both a modern concept of copy and more ancient theories of copia. In this context, this article also explores whether Pliny's Natural History might be a source for the imaginary collection of lost sites and wonders in Du Bellay's Antiquités.","Copiousness; Du Bellay; Pliny the Elder; Roman antiquities; Wonders of the world",,2-s2.0-85032732285

One such case is the political and cultural relation between France and Vietnam, from the Indochinese colonization period to the Francophone Vietnamese Diaspora. It can be argued that the manner in which places are represented in Francophone graphic novels articulates Vietnamese colonial and post-colonial identities. Francophone graphic novels present how the issues of space and power are historically central to the ideology of colonialism. This article therefore analyzes two graphic novels, Maltaite and Lapière's Le Carrefour de Nâm-Pha (1987) and Truong and Leroi's Le Dragon de bambou (1991), and the promotion of imperialist power in the Francophone authors’ depiction of colonial regions like Vietnam. These areas are portrayed as physically and psychologically dangerous, threatening to consume the white colonizer. In contrast, this article looks at Clément Baloup's Quitter Saigon: Mémoires de Viet Kieu (2006) and suggests that his inventive graphic and textual practices create new spaces of belonging for transnational subjects. Baloup's emotionally provocative variations in traditional comic art style, which consist of a detailed focus on human bodies and landscapes, and sacrifice of visual realism, allow him to visually create what Homi Bhabha calls a “third space,” a space of new forms of cultural meaning and production that blurs the limitations of existing boundaries and calls into question established categorizations of culture and identity (34–35). The article thus establishes that, in this “third space,” both the author and readers are participating in the reassessment of a Western conception of Vietnam's heritage and in the reinscription of Vietnamese collective trauma into a transnational history. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","colonial stereotypes; French comics; French Indochina; graphic novels; post-colonial studies; Vietnam",,2-s2.0-85019489339

The image shows the Madonna of the Eleousa type - the Virgin of Tenderness - with the Christ Child seated on her left arm and embracing her with his right arm round her neck, while his left hand is reaching for her collar. The image miraculously appeared on the wall of the unfinished church of Our Lady of Good Counsel on the 25th of April 1467; it was originally titled Madonna del Paradiso and it was only towards the end of the 17th century that the name taken from the patronage of the church became prevalent. From the beginning the picture performed many miracles, attracting numerous pilgrims, first mainly from Latium, and, naturally, Albanian immigrants in particular. Copies of the miraculous image of Genazzano were initially found only in Latiuam and Rome and in the monasteries of the Augustinian friars; it was only in the 18th century that they spread all over Italy and throughout Europe. The greatest credit for this goes to Andrea Bacci, canon in Rome: after he was saved in 1734 from severe mental distress through the intercession of Our Lady of Genazzano, he devoted all of his powers, until his death in 1758, to the global spread of her image and worship. On his initiative, the Augustinian father Angelo Maria De Orgio wrote the book Istoriche notizie della prodigiosa apparizione dell'immagine di Maria Santissima del Buon Consiglio nella chiesa de' padri Agostiniani di Genazzano. It was first published in Rome in 1740 and later in numerous editions elsewhere in Italy, while translations and summaries also appeared in other European countries. European expansion of the image reached the peak after 1753 when at the Augustinian general chapter in Bologna Bacci presented 'his' Madonna to the superiors of foreign monasteries and inspired them to start spreading her miraculous image and worship in their own lands. That same year the Pia unio was established in Genazzano, a universally devised confraternity which accepted pilgrims who visited there, while others could also join through the agency of local Augustinian monasteries. Although the Union flourished, local confraternities of Our Lady of Good Counsel were also founded in the old way - that is with the permission of local bishops and the approval of the Holy See. Copies of the image of Our Lady of Good Counsel have not been systematically addressed in Slovenian expert literature, yet it is possible to read the statement that in the 18th century they were present in every parish church. This boom is said to have coincided with the flourishing of confraternities dedicated to this Marian type. Only four are in fact documented; however, it is true that these confraternities were by far more efficient than others in spreading their confraternity image, since the worship of the Genazzano image and the spreading of its cult were their basic mission. In 1761, a confraternity was established at Nova Cerkev (its seat was at the side altar of St. Stephen, but now the painting is mounted above the tabernacle of the high altar) and another one at Slinovce where the image had been introduced in 1759 by the Cistercians from nearby Kostanjevica. In 1764 a confraternity was founded in the Augustinian church in Ljubljana, while there is no trace of the confraternity that was established in 1766 in Mozirje. The church at Slinovce that was finished in 1777 is the only one that was erected in honour of Our Lady of Good Counsel; later, two more churches in Slovenia were dedicated to her (Završe pri Grobelnem, Podgrad) as well as several chapels. Italian copies can only be found in former Augustinian monasteries (Ljubljana, Sv. Trojica v Slovenskih goricah, Rijeka), while all other pictures of the Genazzano Madonna were executed by Slovenian late-Baroque painters, mainly after reproductive prints. It was believed that the Genazzano miraculous image could not be properly copied, which made the painters' work easier, leaving them sufficient creative freedom. Even the earliest reproductive prints of the Genazzano Madonna - e.g. the one by Antonio Gramignani in the second edition of De Orgio's book of 1748 - were rather different from the original, and later copies of copies moved even farther away because they followed the fashion of each period. Several Slovenian copies of Our Lady of Good Counsel were dated to the 17th century, but it has been established that the oldest is the one acquired from Rome by the Ljubljana Augustinians in 1758. It was only in 1770 that it was mounted on the altar next to the chancel arch, or its original altar was then transferred to its present position. In addition to the high altar at Slinovce, where the miraculous image had to be enlarged by means of embroidered decoration and a large decorative frame, only one more altar survives that is dedicated to Our Lady of Good Counsel: in the parish church at Gomilsko the miraculous image found its place on the altar of St. Barbara. The altar, an excellent work by Ferdinand Gallo, is shared by the two patrons in such a way that Barbara is presented as a dead body in a glass-panelled coffin, and the Madonna reigns above, surrounded by wreaths of clouds, rays and angelic heads. In the first half of the 20th century, Slovenian art history broadly attributed copies of Our Lady of Good Counsel to the painter Fortunat Bergant (1721-1769) who was little known at the time. Only four copies can today reliably be said to be by him: those in the Ursuline convent in Ljubljana, the chapel-of-ease at Vesela Gora, the parish church at Mošnje, and the chapel at Pirče; the latter copy, however, has been in private hands for several years. Of special interest seems to be the painting at Mošnje, as Bergant depicted not only the miraculous image proper, but also its miraculous translation from Shkodër to Genazzano. The motif draws on a devotional print from Klauber's Augsburg engraving workshop which was, in a simplified version, used as a model for the altarpiece in the Augustinian church in Schwäbisch Gmünd. In turn, this served as a model for several only slightly modified devotional prints and book illustrations. In Slovenian patrimony, the miraculous translation of the image was also presented by Anton Lerchinger (ca 1720-after 1787) in his painting for the parish church in Rogatec; in 1801 it was also painted in the altarpiece for Krško. Two of the Genazzano Madonnas, previously attributed to Bergant, were reattributed to Anton Cebej (1722-after 1774) by Ferdinand Šerbelj, who also included a very different painting from Moravče into the latter painter's oeuvre. Judging by related information, it is precisely the Moravče painting that is most likely by Cebej, and additionally that of Preserje and possibly of Beričevo, whereas all the rest differ too clearly to be convincingly attributed to a single hand. The greatest number of copies of Our Lady of Good Counsel were painted by the late-Baroque painter of the Dolenjska region (Lower Carniola), Anton Postl (active 1769-ca 1800), who modelled all of them on Bergant's painting at Vesela Gora. The copy at Sv. Andrej above Zminec is a work by Anton Tušek (1725-1798); the initials F. L. M. of the signature in the painting of 1767 at Srednje Bitnje stand for the painter Franc Lederwasch (1712-1787), whose work has long been ignored or misinterpreted. The almost caricature-like copy of Our Lady of Good Counsel in the chapel-of-ease at Ponikve can be attributed to the painter who in 1773 frescoed the vaults there and executed other paintings and frescoes in the vicinity; this was supposedly Andreas Herrlein (1738-1817), who is documented in the Slovenian lands from 1774 onwards. These were then his first works produced on commission from the Auersperg Counts of Turjak (Schloss Auersperg). Copies of Our Lady of Good Counsel were not always mounted in parish churches as is evidenced by the case of Radovljica. Because the so-called Mater amabilis was venerated from 1760 onwards in the parish church, a painting of the Marian type with her head bowed, there was no place for the new Augustinian Madonna. Hence, the merchant and church treasurer Jurij Pezdič of Radovljica, an eager devotee of both, had a copy of the Genazzano Madonna painted for the chapel-of-ease of St. Clement at Rodine, and several of its copies can also be found in other chapels-of-ease in the Radovljica parish. The number of new copies of the Genazzano painting markedly declined in the 19th century, coinciding with the ever more modern style of the depictions. Two paintings by Štefan Šubic, one at Dolenje Brdo and the other in the chapel-of-ease of St. Francis Xavier in Železniki are worthy of mention, and of particular interest in terms of style is the Biedermaier copy in reverse at Šentvid pri Lukovici.",,,2-s2.0-85029122349

It extends a previous study by the author that described the period 1987–2006, covering the disintegration of state-owned film industry and its transformation to standard film distribution. The first part of the presented study describes the development of various means of dissemination of audiovisual contents with the aim to put classical distribution in the context of other forms of distribution and emphasize that in the course of history its role in the structure of the whole system of dissemination of audiovisual contents has been transformed. The second aim of this chapter is to demonstrate that classical film distribution was forced to digitization by changes in film production, postproduction and other means of dissemination of audiovisual contents. Last but not least, the study shows that while in the past the competition for spectators occurred between classical film distribution and, e.g. television broadcasting, today the main competition occurs between classical liner television broadcasting and online distribution of audiovisual contents. Subsequent description of the development of film distribution during these years details the legislative and social-political context, including subsidy policy of the state. It reveals that the subsidy policy helped the digitization of single-screen cinemas and created very good conditions for their development. However, at the same time it shows that state subventions focus mainly on the production of Czech audiovisual works, while the distribution of foreign art-house films is marginalized. The subsequent chapter focuses on the process of digitization itself, detailing the change of the technology of projection in cinemas and media that allow transfer of audiovisual contents. Next part documents the development of frequentation of cinemas, their revenues and the structure of their offerings. The chapter reveals that the period under question saw a rise in the number of films entering distribution and in film attendance and increase in revenues. At the same time, however, it indicates some problems related to the diversification of offerings and frequentation of cinemas. Furthermore, the study details how the digitization of cinemas changed the relations between distributors and cinema operators and describes the most successful distribution companies on the market during the last ten years, including some smaller companies with distinct offerings, as well as prominent companies of cinema operators. These include not only the chains of multiplexes that play a decisive role on the market but also selected operators of single-screen cinemas, the position of which is notable if we take into account the whole of Europe. Apart from classical theatrical film distribution concentrated on multiplexes and single-screen cinemas, a wide range of alternative public screenings has been recently developing, for which the term event distribution was coined in recent years. A significant part of event distribution is formed by film festivals, which play a significant role especially in the dissemination of art-house films. However, festivals are not the only form of event distribution as other forms take place also in individual regions on various unique occasions. The concluding part of the study explores further technological possibilities, other forms of dissemination and the influence of illegal forms of dissemination of audiovisual contents on the future development of distribution. The study includes a glossary of terms that are related to the development and present state of film distribution. © 2017, National Film Archive. All rights reserved.",,,2-s2.0-85032474898

Sorbent/catalyst materials characterized by stable behaviour over multiple reforming/calcination cycles may ensure to achieve almost stationary operating conditions utilizing a dual fluidized bed system (the reformer and the sorbent regenerator) with a solid circulation loop. Bifunctional, Combined Sorbent-Catalyst Materials (CSCM) are under development to integrate endothermic catalytic reforming and heterogeneous CO2 sorption in one particle, decrease mass and heat transfer resistances and reduce the solid hold-up in the reactors. This paper deals with the numerical simulation of a pilot scale bubbling fluidized bed SE-SMR reactor by means of a Two-Dimensional Computational Fluid-Dynamic (2D CFD) approach. The hydrodynamic picture is supplemented with a comprehensive Particle Grain Model (PGM) previously developed to describe the kinetics of catalytic and sorption functions, and successfully validated with micro-reactor reactivity tests and multi-cycle thermo-gravimetric sorption tests. The effect of repeated carbonation-calcination steps (the “history” of the granular material) is included in the computation of the reactor performance by utilizing the appropriate size of the sorbent grains in the carbonation rate expression. The numerical results show quantitatively the positive influence of carbon dioxide sorption on the reforming process, at different operating conditions, specifically the enhancement of hydrogen yield and reduction of methane residual concentration in the reactor outlet stream. A preliminary validation of CFD simulations is also carried out utilizing experimental data obtained from a pilot scale bubbling fluidized bed SE-SMR reactor (total bed mass ≈ 14 kg). An estimate is provided for the inward heat flow that would be required to operate the reactor in stationary temperature conditions: it is substantially reduced by the exothermic sorption process and could be satisfied by means of the solid circulation loop connecting the SE-SMR reactor to the high temperature calciner in the whole dual fluidized bed system. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bifunctional sorbent-catalyst; CaO based sorbent; CFD reactor model; Sorption enhanced steam methane reforming","Bubble formation; Calcination; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Catalysts; Catalytic reforming; Chemical reactors; Computational fluid dynamics; Environmental technology; Fluid catalytic cracking; Fluid dynamics; Fluidized bed process; Granular materials; Heat resistance; Heat transfer; Hydrogen production; Methane; Small nuclear reactors; Sorbents; Sorption; Steam reforming; Different operating conditions; Environmental footprints; Fluidized bed reactors; Mass and heat transfers; Reactor modeling; Residual concentrations; Sorbent catalysts; Temperature conditions; Fluidized beds",2-s2.0-85027506403

Kochetov in M.N. Katkov's editions - the Moskovskie Vedomosti newspaper and the Russkiy Vestnik magazine in the 1880s is considered. During the specified period these editions were leaders of Russian conservative journalism. Kochetov's publications are considered, their subject, perspective and genre specifics are analysed; earlier unpublished letters of the journalist, reminiscences of him are studied. Most part of publications of Kochetov in Moskovskie Vedomosti belongs to 1880-1882. The journalist reported from the funeral of General M.D. Skobelev and from the site on the Kursk railroad accident in the summer of 1882, wrote notes about openings of art exhibitions, reviews for the ""Theatrical Chronicle"" column, had the ""Notes of a Newspaper Reader"" column, published an extensive traveling sketch ""From a Summer Excursion"". Kochetov was particularly successful in writing operational materials written ""without a delay"". Among them reports and correspondence from the place of the accident on the Moscow and Kursk railroad in 1882 are of the greatest interest. Kochetov gave the objective picture of the tragedy, described the course of events, details of search works, analysed factors which became the cause of the accident. As a result of his own mistake, in 1882 Kochetov was forced to leave Moskovskie Vedomosti. In search of earnings, he addressed A.S. Suvorin and soon became a special correspondent in his newspaper Novoe Vremya. However, his relations with Katkov did not stop. Sent by Novoe Vremya to Poland as a special correspondent, Kochetov regularly wrote to the editor of Moskovskie Vedomosti about actions of administration and moods of local population, remaining a reliable source of information for Katkov. A considerable part of information given by Kochetov had a confidential character. In 1886, Russkiy Vestnik published Kochetov's sketch ""The Rumelia Revolution"". The sketch attempted to objectively analyse the events which led to the association of the Bulgarian principality with the autonomous Turkish province of Eastern Rumelia in the fall of 1885. The analysis of Kochetov's journalistic texts, correspondence, memoirs allowed to draw a conclusion on the community of the social and political views of the journalist and the Moskovskie Vedomosti editor. Kochetov and Katkov were united by a sincere conviction in the need of rigid centralization of the power, a view on autocracy as on the only form of government acceptable in Russia, a critical attitude towards the highest St. Petersburg bureaucracy, protection of orthodox values. They were close in the straightforwardness of assessment expressed in their journalistic texts, the uncompromising stand and obstinacy in situations when matters concerned their professional reputation.","Correspondent; E.L.

The genius poet and philosopher later known as Nizami Ganjavi, whose works would profoundly impact the literary school through awakening the spirits and thoughts of mankind for centuries, was born. Nizami Ganjavi long ago became more than a descendant of Azerbaijan. His timeless verses rank among the most valuable wealth of mankind, while he himself reached the pantheon of history's most exalted descendants. Not one, but eight, centuries have elapsed since then, yet the vitality of Nizami reaches beyond the temporal borders of his clairvoyance, leading the way to eternity. A genius German poet emphasized the value of high modesty by pointing to seven great poets (Ferdowsi, Anvari, Nizami, Sadi, Rumi, Hafez, Jami) distinguished within Persian-language poetry: ""Even though the East has given the biggest advantage to only 7 of its poets, there are a lot of poets superior to me among the rest of the preferred ones"". Nizami's name was Ilyas, However, certain sources claim that his name was Ahmad (for example, the source entitled ""Khulasat al-afkar"" notes his name as Ahmad ibn Yusif Muayyad). Nizami is a nickname of the poet. His pseudonym was Nizam ad-din. In the medieval Moslem East there was a tradition of indicating kunya, the son's name, along with the name of famous persons. The kunya of Nizami is Mohammad. In his various hemistiches the poet speaks to his son Mohammad through admonishing him. From his first poem to his last, Nizami repeatedly brings the name of Ganja to his hemistiches. Certain sources (for instance, Dovlatshah Samargandi, the XV century) inform about Nizami's brother Givami Mutarrizi. The literary relics written by Givami Mutarrizi that we possess today attest to his high skills in the genre of qasida-masnavi, as well as hiss overall poetic talent and savy poetic technique. However, we lack definitive scientific evidence regarding the native brotherhood links between Mutarrizi and Nizami. Meanwhile it is hardly accidental that we mentioned this contentious couplet relating to the place of birth of Nizami. Throughout history, along with those seeking to claim ownership of many Azerbaijani values and territories, there have also been people attempting to appropriate the genius descendants of Azerbaijan, and such attempts are happening to this day. During Nizami's era, two languages - Arabic and Persian - dominated science and literature in the near and Middle East. All scientific works were written in Arabic, while poets from a diverse range of nationalities in Central Asia, the Caucasus, Iran and India crafted their literary heritage in a single language - Persian. With clear command and knowledge of information in the most varied fields of science reflected in his works, Nizami demonstrates that he is a highly-educated person. His earliest known verses indicate his high poetical techniques. And this is evidence of Nizami's engagement in poetry not as an amateur but as a genuine professional, someone who perfectly mastered the theoretical basis of this art from the very beginning. The canons of that age necessitated, first of all, perfect command of Persian and Arabic in order to master such a wide range of universal knowledge. Nizami wrote his seminal works ""Divan"" and ""Khamsa"" in Persian. © 2017 International Information Institute.","Archive materials; Azerbaijan; Ganja; Literature; Manuscripts; Nizami Ganjavi; Poem",,2-s2.0-85028408385

Zhukovsky's Jerusalem project (on materials of political essays and religious and philosophical prose of the 1840s)",2017,"Vestnik Tomskogo Gosudarstvennogo Universiteta, Filologiya",,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018322553&doi=10.17223%2f19986645%2f46%2f8&partnerID=40&md5=2782a7795b6b9ce9d73d7d6c7a4f258d","On the material of V. A. Zhukovsky's political journalism and religious-philosophical prose of the 1840s, the underlying intent and basis of his proposal to free the Holy Sepulcher and Jerusalem from the power of the Turkish Sultan (the so-called Jerusalem project of the writer) are considered. Vectors of internal communicative intentions of the author that spawned not only Zhukovsky's later art works of, but also a specific action plan proposed by the poet to the Russian Tsar and described in personal letters of the late 1849 - early 1850 to Grand Dukes Konstantin Nikolaevich and Alexander are identified and connected with the interpretation of specific historical events. The focus of the study is on the contexts in which these proposals are expressed. After his crisis of the rethinking of German idealistic philosophy, guided, like many leading men of the 1830s-1840, by a ""search for a high mission"", Zhukovsky conceives a project, the implementation of which, in his opinion, would have solved the task of restoring the original integrity of being at all levels of its representation. Almost all researchers refer to the lyric-epic works of late Zhukovsky (primarily, the poem ""A Wandering Jew"") with obvious parallels with his Jerusalem project as to contexts of this project. In the article, the author dwells on the late prose of the writer that shows the essential equivalence of the proposal under consideration, which allows to clarify its genesis, content and pathos. First of all, attention is paid to Zhukovsky's reasoning of the complex and dangerous crisis in Europe, threatening it with death, and of the ways to save it. The most important characteristic of the European civilization, according to the writer, is atheism that, in his opinion, causes all other painful life-threatening phenomena. Zhukovsky's prediction clear: if not to take action, Europe will suffer from ""universal hatred"" and destruction. Zhukovsky anticipates the collapse of Europe and interprets it in the light of his late 1840s philosophy of history that reflects the fundamental ideas of the Christian concept of the historical development of the humankind. Zhukovsky's prosaic discourse about Europe discusses the question of Russia and its role in saving Europe and Christendom. One of the frequent characteristics of Russia in Zhukovsky's articles is the ""integrity"" in it of faith in God and the sanctity of autocracy already destroyed in Europe. Liberation, on the initiative of the Russian Tsar, of the Holy Sepulcher from the power of the Turkish Sultan seems to the writer to be the most important event as Jerusalem with its Holy sites, in Zhukovsky's opinion, is a metaphysical phenomenon that itself is the answer to the vexed questions of history. Zhukovsky sees the success of his Jerusalem project in its peaceful implementation. The conclusion that the Jerusalem project originated from Zhukovsky's late ideas about the possibility of the return of the ideal to the earthly life, its connection with reality, and nurtured theses ideas.","Jerusalem; Palestine; Prose of the 1840s; Romanticism; The Jerusalem project of Zhukovsky; V.A.

Such interpretations abound in the Lutheran orthodoxy (the sermons of Hermann Samson), the works of the Russian Orthodox authors, who speak of the spies of the Pope, etc. The meaning of the term 'Jesuit' has often acquired negative connotations in the Russian and Latvian languages, describing such qualities as swindling, deceiving, performing clandestine political manoeuvres. During the twentieth and thirtieth of the 20th century public discussions were taking place encompassing the standpoint of the Lutheran orthodoxy and the 19th century hysterical Russificationism.The historiography of the Soviet period added a measure of ideologized anti-Catholic propaganda. All these interpretations are nowadys sometimes to be met with in a single self-contradictory and yet mutually interdependent hotchpotch. As a kind of exception to this general trend one notices the works of the researchers of Latgale cultural heritage (M. Boiko, S. Kalvane, P. Zeile, etc/) and art historians (K. Ogle and others). These scholars are accentuating the profound contribution of the Order of Jesuits to the formation of the cultural processes in Latvia and the whole Baltic region. It is a comparatively new trendency within the hisotoriography and the intellectual life in general. The well-known Church historian John Meily has written that the history of the Jesuits originated at the intersection of the MiddleAges and the Modern times. The Jesuits are compressed between two epochs - the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. They have acquired some of the features of the Scholastic thought and have taken from the Renaissance the methods of humanism and the vision of the world, thus creating their own specific method ane their world-view. The Jesuits are not confined within the walls of a monastery, as it was characteristic of the monasticisn of the Middle Ages. They live among the people and share the concerns of their spiritual and material needs. If in the Middle Ages the monks were leaving the world, and the people to meet with God, the Jesuits stepped out into the world to meet the people and God there. The Jesuits became the first religious order of the Catholic Church that fully understood the importance of education and sciences, and they accepted these activities as their main means of serving God.The world had not witnessed before such a wide-spread network of schools and other educational establishments as a internationlly extended system. These schools became the centres of culture and sciences; they staged theatrical and ballet performances, established astronomical observatories. They involved the students in lay service, fostered their spiritual growth, helped them to acquire modes of Spiritual Exerises, so as to realize their faith in serving everywhere: in prisons, on the streets, in orphanages and old people's homes. Jesuits entered the God-forsaken and the people-forsaken peripheral locations, yet they did not dwell therein. Going into such peripheral, marginal places appeared as a stumbling block, originating in the Renaissance thought about the requirement to disseminate new ideas from the Centre, and somtimes - just the opposite - from one periferal location to the other, thus exchanging of experiences and human resources. The Jesuits were to be met everywhere, where new ideas were generated, experiments performed; they were generators themselve - the ones that disseminated the results of the new ideas and experiments in the perifery. This was the case concerning the Baltic (former Livonia), which had become during the Reformation a kind of periferal region - many Renaissance ideas arrived here from the Western and Southern parts of Europe, due to the religious education and cultural activities of the Order of Jesuits.",,,2-s2.0-85029645514

Gorenstein in the essay ""My Chekhov of the Autumn and Winter of 1968"".The purpose of this article is to explore the strategies and tactics of F. Gorenstein's interpretation of A. Chekhov's prose. Social and historical reasons for F. Gorenstein's interest in Chekhov's prose, the main contexts and ideas of the essay ""My Chekhov in the Autumn and Winter of 1968"" are determined. In the preamble to the essay, F. Gorenstein gives a most generalized ethical description of the time, characterising it as an epoch of a moral crisis, the time of the overall advent of evil and violence that roots back to the 19th century. The fundamental civilisational, social and ideological changes of the 19th century are the industrial revolution, the formation of a civilisation of consumption and a person of the masses, the crisis of religion and its degeneracy, the dominance of atheism as a scientific world outlook and the total unbelief as a special kind of consciousness. A person of ""unbelief"", a person of the masses exists in the pre-moral stage of development and is confined to physiological needs; a special social class - lackeys - is taking shape and being segregated within the masses. It is a social group where the notion of the person's worth and the human dignity has been lost. The lackeys become leaders of the masses, of the crowd. An analytical sketch of the 19th-century events is necessary for F. Gorenstein in order to provide the supporting rationale for the aspects of his interpretation of Chekhov's prose: the analysis of the nature of the depressed mind in the situation of outward social freedom, the correlation of the biological and the morals in person. In the exegesis of the short stories ""A New Dacha"" (1899) and ""In the Ravine"" (1890) the writer employs the tactics of reduction: all the multifaceted range of problems is reduced and regarded either through the two main conflicts (""A New Dacha""), or through the two central characters (""In the Ravine""). The key of the conflicts lies in the psychology, in the insight of the inner nature of a person oppressed for a long while, of which the first reaction to freedom is grievance and malice accumulated from years of humiliation and fear. In ""In the Ravine"", both female characters are representative of the pre-moral existence. The cruelty of Aksinia can be subdued during the history of human evolution, but the submission of Lipa, who is able to live after the terrible death of her child, is related to the total ontological vitality, rooted in the human nature, a vitality that demonstrates the human ability to survive against all odds, to live after all and despite of everything. It is in this that the danger for her spiritual inner life lies. Chekhov's prose becomes a problem field for F. Gorenstein. It allows him to unfold his own thinking over the human genesis and their biosocial duality, to connect evolution and the problem of the self-preservation of humankind with the formation of ideals which exclude violence. A feature of Chekhov's world perception is reflected in the fact that it was deprived of the idealization of life, deprived of the dependence on ideas, and appealed to the reality of life. The ""confirmation"" strategy and the ""reduction"" tactics F. Gorenstein used are to detect the confirmation of the reader's position in the narrative material. The additional historical, cultural and literary contexts are created and used for strengthening the argumentation; these contexts are easily switched according to the principle of musical registers, depending upon the objectives in one selection of text or another, creating both the necessary associative and intertextual ""density"" of his prose and the additional informative and notional content.","A.

In 1936 the picture was described by a priest and art historian Kazimirs Jasens. He indicates that the painting is located in the chapel at Jelgava Roman Catholic graveyard. The artefact was considered to be destroyed during World War II, but luckily it was found in 2013 far away from its original place, in Kaunata, Southeast Latvia. The painting is remarkable for more than one reason. First, the documented history of its origins. The Jesuit chronicles at Jelgava have records of an incident in 1737: a citizen Peter Plagmann had insulted the Mother of God in public, which had caused repercussions among his fellow citizens. Not only the Roman Catholics and Lutherans in Jelgava were involved in the incident; the City Council soon joined the argument. As a result, the offender received an unusual punishment, namely - to finance two paintings: 'Immaculate Conception of Mary'and a smaller one of'Sts Joachim and Anna'. Later both pictures were placed in respective side altars of St. George's church. They stayed there till the second half of the 19th century, when the altars were rebuilt in Neogothic form, together with altar paintings by Julius Doring: a copy of the 'Sistine Madonna' (1863) and 'The Holy Family' (1868). In the records of episcopal visitations we find descriptions of the painting, which augment the information in the book by Kazimirs Jasens: the head of the Holy Virgin is decorated with 12 silver stars, her foot rests on a silver crescent moon; above the Virgin's breast a large silver heart is visible together with a golden crucifix; both the Most Holy Virgin and Child Jesus have silver crowns. The older texts refer to the painting as 'Virgin of Immaculate Conception'. This is not entirely correct as in the Jelgava painting Our Lady is pictured together with the Child, which is not usual in the iconography of the Immaculate Conception. Against the background of golden clouds, the Most Holy Virgin stands in full height upon a crescent moon, holding Jesus on her right. Her long red gown stretches to the ground, leaving only the toes of her bare feet uncovered. Starting at her right shoulder, a mantle of deep blue twists around the Virgin's body, while a pale gold robe with large undulating folds covers the Child. The Virgin's veil is also white, it falls over her shoulders and back, underscoring the deep golden shine of her long, curly hair. The crescent moon is placed on a symbolic representation of the earth. A sarcastically grinning snake is curled around it, holding in its long fangs an apple - a reminder of the fall from grace. Yet its advantage is but brief: firmly held by his mother, the little Child Jesus uses a long cross spear to press the head of the evil one to the ground, demonstrating his victory. In spite of the dramatic situation, the body and face of the Child project peace. A similar attitude is visible in the character of the Virgin: the ideal face, dark, slightly slanting dark eyes, long nose and straight lips express peaceful contemplation. The baroque contrapposto and the swishing garments do not interfere with the general air of serious solemnity. The composition of the painting indicates that it should be attributed to the iconographic type of Our Lady of Victory. This is the only known instance of this type in Latvia. The back of the painting bears an important testimony. Information of both the author and the origin of the painting has been inscribed on the wooden boards, ""A Joannae Andrea Leitnerpicta. It is known that Johann Andreas Leitner (Leutner; Leuttner, Läuttner, 1678-1745) represented a large and distinct family of artists, working in Jelgava in 17th-18th centuries. The painter's mastery can be seen both in the convincing figure of the Mother of God and the filigree of the details (pearls, hair, the shiny teeth and relief skin of the snake). On the left side of the painting, there are inscriptions about the repaintings in 1801; the differences of the hand are markable (e.g. fragments of the right arm of the Virgin, her left foot, clothes, etc.). It cannot be excluded that some repairs have been conducted after removing the silver elements. Regardless of the ravages of time, the Our Lady of Victory in Jelgava holds value both artistically and ideologically and significantly enriches the culture of Latvia.",,,2-s2.0-85029621447

In 1796, an English country physician, Edward Jenner, discovered that inoculating mankind with cowpox can protect them from smallpox (Riedel S, Edward Jenner and the history of smallpox and vaccination. Proceedings (Baylor University. Medical Center) 18(1):21, 2005). Based on the vaccination worldwide, we finally succeeded in the eradication of smallpox in 1977 (Henderson, Vaccine 29:D7–D9, 2011). Other disabling and lethal diseases, like poliomyelitis and measles, are targeted for eradication (Bonanni, Vaccine 17:S120–S125, 1999). Although vaccine development and administration are tremendously successful and cost-effective practices to human health, no vaccine is 100% safe for everyone because each person reacts to vaccinations differently given different genetic background and health conditions. Although all licensed vaccines are generally safe for the majority of people, vaccinees may still suffer adverse events (AEs) in reaction to various vaccines, some of which can be serious or even fatal (Haber et al., Drug Saf 32(4):309–323, 2009). Hence, the double-edged sword of vaccination remains a concern. To support integrative AE data collection and analysis, it is critical to adopt an AE normalization strategy. In the past decades, different controlled terminologies, including the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) (Brown EG, Wood L, Wood S, et al., Drug Saf 20(2):109–117, 1999), the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (NCI, The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Available from: http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html. Access on 7 Oct 2015), and the World Health Organization (WHO) Adverse Reactions Terminology (WHO-ART) (WHO, The WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology – WHO-ART. Available from: https://www.umc-products.com/graphics/28010.pdf), have been developed with a specific aim to standardize AE categorization. However, these controlled terminologies have many drawbacks, such as lack of textual definitions, poorly defined hierarchies, and lack of semantic axioms that provide logical relations among terms. A biomedical ontology is a set of consensus-based and computer and human interpretable terms and relations that represent entities in a specific biomedical domain and how they relate each other. To represent and analyze vaccine adverse events (VAEs), our research group has initiated and led the development of a community-based ontology: the Ontology of Adverse Events (OAE) (He et al., J Biomed Semant 5:29, 2014). The OAE has been found to have advantages to overcome the drawbacks of those controlled terminologies (He et al., Curr Pharmacol Rep:1–16. doi:10.1007/s40495-016-0055-0, 2014). By expanding the OAE and the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) (He et al., VO: vaccine ontology. In The 1st International Conference on Biomedical Ontology (ICBO-2009). Nature Precedings, Buffalo. http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3552/version/1; J Biomed Semant 2(Suppl 2):S8; J Biomed Semant 3(1):17, 2009; Ozgur et al., J Biomed Semant 2(2):S8, 2011; Lin Y, He Y, J Biomed Semant 3(1):17, 2012), we have also developed the Ontology of Vaccine Adverse Events (OVAE) to represent known VAEs associated with licensed vaccines (Marcos E, Zhao B, He Y, J Biomed Semant 4:40, 2013). In this book chapter, we will first introduce the basic information of VAEs, VAE safety surveillance systems, and how to specifically query and analyze VAEs using the US VAE database VAERS (Chen et al., Vaccine 12(10):960–960, 1994). In the second half of the chapter, we will introduce the development and applications of the OAE and OVAE. Throughout this chapter, we will use the influenza vaccine Flublok as the vaccine example to launch the corresponding elaboration (Huber VC, McCullers JA, Curr Opin Mol Ther 10(1):75–85, 2008). Flublok is a recombinant hemagglutinin influenza vaccine indicated for active immunization against disease caused by influenza virus subtypes A and type B. On January 16, 2013, Flublok was approved by the FDA for the prevention of seasonal influenza in people 18 years and older in the USA.

However, diasporas of different ethnic and political backgrounds may carry these relations out in different ways. Estonians who live outside Estonia have a long-standing tradition of organising cultural festivals-this ensures the cultural continuity for different diaspora generations and unites new immigrants with the exiles from WWII. My article gives a short overview of such festivals, which are called Estonian Days, focussing on the idea and organisational problems of the Estonian Days held in Gothenburg in 1983 under the title of Estival. This was a special event as the organisers attempted, for the first time after WWII, to bring together the Estonians from the homeland and from the diaspora. My research is based on the collection of Hain Rebas' materials held at the Estonian Cultural History Archive and on the materials published in the press. The Estonian Days have a long history. They were first held on the West Coast of the USA in 1953, then in Australia in 1954. In Canada, the tradition was launched in 1957 and in Sweden, in 1968. Modelled on the regional festivals, the global format was soon created in North America-the Worldwide Estonian Days were held in Toronto in 1972; later, the global festival was called Esto. The traditions of both the regional Estonian Days and the Estos are still alive and now, they draw together the diaspora and resident Estonians. Prior to Estonia's regaining of independence, the Estonian Days were a cultural and political event of the Estonian diaspora society and both of these aspects were of equal importance. The program of Estonian Days contains micro song festivals, sports competitions, art exhibitions, literary events as well as discussion evenings and conferences on political themes. A manifestation was held in the public city space where well-known politicians gave speeches demanding the recognition of the Estonians' right for self-determination and the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Estonia. At the Estonian Days in Sweden in 1968, the discussion about communicating on the institutional level with the Estonians in the homeland became heated, opinions fell to both pro and contra. Organisers of Estival '83 decided to take a step forward from the discussions and to invite the Mixed Choir of the Estonian Radio Broadcasting to participate in the festival. Estonian choral singing tradition was a highly appreciated component of national culture both at home and in exile. The organisers of Estival saw choral singing as a potential for uniting all the Estonians. At a meeting of exile Estonian organisations, the chairman of the Estival board Hain Rebas explained that the Estonians in Sweden should manifest national solidarity with the Estonians in the home country, who make up 90% of all the Estonians. Inviting of an Estonian choir to the Estival should have a positive effect on the identity of all Estonians. The organisers wished to have the former president of the USA, Jimmy Carter, as the keynote speaker at the political manifestation, and in case if he refused to come, there should be some other spokesman of democratic values (e.g., the member of the European Parliament Otto von Habsburg, the Chief Secretary of the Amnesty International Thomas Hammerberg or the Prime Minister of Sweden Olaf Palme). The organisers of the Estival planned to have at one and the same event a singing choir from Soviet Estonia and a top politician representing some democratic state. If this plan had been realised, it would have meant the public opposition of two different ideologies. In archival documents and print media, it emerged that this idea caused criticism and controversy in the exile society. Some exile politicians were sure that the festival would cause a scandal. Despite criticism, the organisers sent invitations to both the politicians and the mixed choir of Estonian Radio. None of the politicians was able to come to the Estival for different reasons. However, several of them recognised the cultural achievements and political aspirations of the exile Estonians and wished them success for the future. The mixed choir of Estonian Radio also did not arrive at the festival, but they did not clarify the reasons that had made them turn down the invitation. The Estonian State Academic Male Choir (RAM) was, in 1967, the first Estonian choir to visit Sweden after WWII. The exile society was not engaged in organising the RAM's concerts but according to newspapers, they made up a large part of the audience. The concerts took place under the supervision of the Union for Developing Cultural Relations with Estonians Abroad (VEKSA, active from 1960-1991) in the framework of the Swedish and Soviet Union's joint project. Cultural communication of the Soviet Estonia with the Estonians abroad was allowed only through this organisation. Performance of the mixed choir of Estonian Radio in the way as the organisers of the Estival '83 had planned would have created an entirely new situation in the cultural communication. It would have meant the establishing of direct contacts between the exile society and the Soviet Estonian choir (the organisers did not contact VEKSA). The real-life political situation actually ruled the plan out already at the very beginning. If we look at it from the side of Soviet Estonia, it was clear that no musician could tour abroad without the support of VEKSA. If we look at it from the viewpoint of the exile society, it was known that a number of influential exile figures did not favour the development of relations on the institutional level with the occupied homeland because it could indicate the political recognition of the occupation. The mixed choir of Estonian Radio, which belonged to the state broadcasting company and was financed by the state, could be treated as an institution. Thus, the plans of the organisers of the Estival faced all at once a number of problems which could not be solved in the political context of the early 1980s. A breakthrough in the direct cultural communication between the resident and exile Estonians occurred at the Worldwide Estonian Days in Melbourne in 1988 where 150 people from Estonia participated in the festival. The RAM Boys' Choir was among the participants. The Australian Estonian newspapers wrote about the lessening of the gulf between the two halves and stressed the task of the Estonians of the Free World of supporting cultural communication and the striving for freedom of the Estonians in the homeland. The importance of the Estival '83 in the long process of uniting the Estonians of the diaspora and the homeland has been overshadowed by Esto '88. Despite the attempts at achieving a more global dimension through the political manifestation and at strengthening the Estonians' feeling of unity through choir music, Estival still remained a regional event of the Estonians in Sweden. However, both of these festivals clearly demonstrate that, first, culture and politics are closely intertwined and second, the exile society purposefully applied the symbiosis of culture and politics in the restoration of such kind of Estonia with which the Estonians all over the world would be able to identify without any conflicts.","Cultural relations; Diaspora; Estonia; Festivals",,2-s2.0-85031324907

Lithium batteries are characterized by high specific energy, high efficiency and long life. These unique properties have made lithium batteries the power sources of choice for the consumer electronics market with a production of the order of billions of units per year. Although today's Li-ion technology has conquered the portable electronic markets and is still improving. These batteries are also expected to find a prominent role as ideal electrochemical storage systems in renewable energy plants, as well as power systems for sustainable vehicles, such as hybrid and electric vehicles. Lithium batteries are important for energy storage in a wide variety of applications including consumer electronics, transportation and large-scale energy production. The performance of lithium batteries depends on the materials used. This review presents the state-of-the-art knowledge on crystalline, composite and amorphous inorganic solid lithium ion conductors, which are of interest as potential solid electrolytes in lithium batteries. Recent material developments of fast solid lithium ion conductors are reviewed. The discussion of crystalline Li ion conductors includes perovskite-type Lithium Lanthanum Titanates, NASICON-type, LiSICON- and Thio-LiSICON type Li ion conductors, as well as garnet-type Li ion conducting oxides. The part on composite Li ion conductors discusses materials containing oxides and mesoporous oxides. In the amorphous Li ion conductor part oxide and sulfide-phosphate based glasses are presented. As glassy solid electrolytes have large potential for a number of electrochemical applications, the most important among them being the solid state batteries. In order to successfully accomplish these applications it is necessary to have a background of the science and technology of glassy solid electrolytes. This presentation gives a brief account of the formation of glassy solid electrolytes, factors affecting ionic conductivity in these materials. Typical results have been discussed to get some insight into the glassy solid electrolytes. The status of lithium battery involving lithium conducting glasses and the challenges in its development have been highlighted. A lithium solid battery has features such as flexibility in shape of a cell design, leak proof of electrolyte, high safety, etc., but posses the challenge of how close its electrical performance can be made to that of a liquid electrolyte cell. Therefore, various efforts have so far been made to improve the ionic conductivity of the solids especially in consideration of its practical application to use at room temperature. The ionic conductivity of solid now reaches 1×10-3 S cm-1 at room temperature. Special emphasis is placed on the correlation between the composition, structure, and electrical transport properties of inorganic crystalline materials in terms of the required functional properties for practical applications. Fundamental advances in the solid state chemistry of ionic conducting solids are essential for clean energy supply. Several new directions are discussed in this context for solid electrolytes. This paper reviews the solid electrolytes in view of their electrochemical and physical properties for the applications in lithium batteries. This reviews the history and the present status of the research and development of solid electrolyte in the lithium battery, and presents an outlook of the future research and development activities. The paper also introduces the improvement of lithium polymer secondary batteries using solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) such as poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), poly(acrylonitrile) (PAN), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) with the performance and the applications of its present commercial products. We have tried to focus on the study of these advanced solid inorganic and polymer electrolytes by evaluating their use in rechargeable lithium batteries. Important factors for the solid electrolyte such as effect of preparative parameters, characterization techniques, parameters for the battery performance, importance of ionic conductivity has been explained. This article is the story of the development of solid electrolyte and it describes how the difficulties were surmounted. This review focuses first on the present status of lithium battery technology, then on its near future development and finally it examines important new directions aimed at achieving quantum jumps in energy and power content.

Among the objects, huge totem poles with elaborated carvings were especially sought-after. According to native tradition, generally totem poles went back to Mother Nature once they fell down from rot and age. But early travellers and ethnographers saw it differently - in their opinion it was important to save the poles, and so many were transported to museums in Canada, USA and even to Europe where they can be admired up to this day. To prevent further export, a special set of rules - an ""Indian Act Amendment"" in the year 1927 - was imposed stating that totem poles could not be sold (not even by the owners/the natives themselves) or removed without permission from the authorities. Among the persons that lobbied for the regulations were ethnographic pioneers like Marius Barbeau and Harland I. Smith. A Gift with Complications The key role in the following story was played by a very elaborated totem pole from the village of Nootka on Vancouver Island. This pole became much talked about as it was given as a gift from the ""Moachaht-indians"" to ""His Excellency the Governor-General Lord Willingdon and lady Wil-lingdon"" on their visit to the village at Friendly Cove in April 1929. The Willingdon's gratefully accepted the gift on behalf of the British Queen with the prospect in mind that it would serve as a suitable decoration for their ""Rideau Hall"" residence back home in Ottawa. But it turned out that the gift was more complicated than had been foreseen. The natives were practicing ceremonial potlatch traditions that implied exchanges of gifts - symbolic as well as material. According to these rituals a gift was not necessarily followed by a removal of the object or a change of location. A gift should of course be gratefully received with all possible grace, but it could also be returned with the same grace, sometimes with some added valuable goods. Neglecting this reciprocity was seen as rude and shameful. Evidently the Excellences and their staff knew too little about this when they asked for assistance in arranging for the transport of the pole to Ottawa. A bewildered functionary at the Department of Indian Affairs in Victoria wrote an answer explaining that probably nobody in the village had expected that the pole should ever leave the premises. On the contrary, according to his understanding it had already during the gift ceremony been agreed that the pole should not be removed. After complicated debates on the character of gifts and gifts in return, a framed photo of the two Excellences as well as a pocket watch with suitable engravings on the lid was produced, sent and received. But the problems did not end. Instead the whole process of the totem pole gift was questioned by important chiefs at the same time as the story started to engage journalists, all together something that alarmed the administration in Ottawa. It was time for reconsideration and to inform the Excellences about the consequences of the gift that they had accepted. Should the project be continued on the basis of such unsure premises? Maybe the best strategy would be to let the pole stay in the village? This became the decision and the totem pole was left where it stood, with a brass sign bolted to it stating that the pole was presented to ""HIS EXCELLENCY LORD WILLINGDON, GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF CANADA/⋯/WHO REQUESTED SUB-CHIEF TO ALLOW THE POLE TO REMAIN IN ITS PRESENT SITE AND TO BE CARED FOR BY THE NOOT-KA INDIANS IN RECOLLECTION OF THE FIRST VISIT PAID BY A GOVERNOR-GENERAL TO FRIENDLY COVE AND TO THE WEST COAST OF THE ISLAND OF VANCOUVER IN April 1929."" The Swedes and Their Totem Pole The matter of Her Majesty's totem pole was thereby brought to its end. But during the same period another adventure with a totem pole in focus began. In December 1929 a letter was sent from the ""Prime Minister, Province of British Columbia"" S. F. Tolmie to the ""Office for Indian Affairs"" in Ottawa with questions concerning removed and/or sold totem poles. The Prime Minister underlined that export of totem poles was forbidden according to the ""The Indian Act"", but in spite of this statement it seemed as if the central administration in Ottawa gave permission for poles to flood out of the country to the USA and Europe. And Tolmie did not (with a smile?) withhold himself from referring to the known fact that even the high Governor General had restrained himself ""⋯when he refused to take from the Province a totem pole presented to him at Friendly Cove. To make sure that it would not be removed in the future, he had a brass plate placed on it, to be held in trust for them and the Department of Indian Affairs"". With this subtle reinterpretation of the history of the gift the Governor Generals actions appeared as a model of good behaviour. And on basis of this example Tolmie wanted to raise questions about the destinies of other poles. For example: ""Was a totem pole removed from Gardner's Canal in 1927 or 1928?"" And for sure it was. The totem pole at Gardner Canal was cut down and brought out of British Columbia by a Swedish Consul and a Norwegian Indian Agent and quietly shipped from Prince Rupert to the free harbour of Stockholm where it arrived early spring 1929. The Swedish Prime Minister Hjalmar Branting had removed the custom charges and members from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences attended the reception as the pole was re-erected at the Museum of Ethnography in Stockholm. The subsequent story of this pole, its repatriation and the following problems of balancing of gifts is presented in the monograph Hövdingens totempåle - om konsten att utbyta gåvor. (= Chief G'psgo-lox's totem pole and the art of exchanging gifts) (Björklund 2016).","Indigenous people; Museology; Northwest coast; Potlatch; Repatriation",,2-s2.0-85028295313

Our aim was to explore the usefulness of an in vitro immunodepletion assay and an allergen microarray test in the identification of IgE-mediated cross-reactive food allergens in patients with suspected FDEIA or food-dependent exercise-induced urticaria and panallergen sensitization. Methods: Three patients with a history of food dependent exercise induced urticaria/anaphylaxis and food panallergen sensitization in whom a food-exercise challenge was not feasible were selected: a 25-year-old man with cholinergic urticaria who experienced generalized urticaria and angioedema during a soccer match after drinking a peach-based soft drink; a 19-year-old woman with allergic rhinitis and controlled asthma who experienced anaphylactic shock while playing soccer, having eaten walnuts in the previous 90 min; and a 57-year-old man with baker’s asthma who experienced four episodes of anaphylaxis during exercise after ingesting wheat-containing food. All individuals underwent a diagnostic work-up with skin prick tests, specific IgE (sIgE) and ImmunoCAP ISAC test. For the in vitro immunodepletion procedure, patients’ serum was pre-incubated with the suspected native allergen (peach, walnut, or wheat) in solid phase (ImmunoCAP). The eluted serum, containing unbound IgE, was collected and samples were re-tested using Immunocap ISAC 112 and compared with baseline results. Results: All individuals were sensitized to lipid transfer proteins. The first patient was sensitized to Pru p 3, Cor a 8, Jug r 3, and Ara h 9; after pre-incubation with peach there was 100% depletion of sIgE to all components. The second patient was sensitized to Pru p 3, Cor a 8, Jug r 3, and Ara h 9; immunodepletion with walnut depleted sIgE to Ara h 9 by 67%, Pru p 3 and Pla a 3 (60%), Art v 3 (75%), Jug r 3 (88%), and Cor a 8 (100%). The third patient was sensitized to Pru p 3, Jug r 3, Ara h 9, and Tri a 14; immunodepletion with wheat depleted Tri a 14 only (100%).

Themystical view on the essence of art, encountered from Orphic and Pythagorean thinkers to Heideggerand Gadamer, believes that art is a divine gift and the artist - a messenger of heavenly thoughts. Butthe issue of religious themes' presence in art arises especially since modern times, after the eighteenthcentury, when religion starts to be constantly and vehemently attacked (from the Enlightenment andthe French or the Bolshevik Revolution to the ""political correctness"" nowadays). Art is no longer justthe material transposition of a religious content; instead, religion itself becomes a theme in art, whichallows artists to relate to it in different ways - from veneration to disapproval and blasphemy. However,there have always been artists to see art in its genuine meaning, in close connection with the religioussentiment. An case in point is the work of Bill Viola.

We tested the idea that creativity (planning an artwork) would influence the functional connectivity between regions involved in the default mode network (DMN), implicated in divergent thinking and generating novel ideas, and the executive control network (EN), implicated in evaluating and selecting ideas. We measured functional connectivity with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) during three different conditions: rest, visual imagery of the alphabet and planning an artwork to be executed immediately after the scanning session.

Created by the French Cultural Cooperation in 1995, this festival is now considered the most important pan-African contemporary dance event. It constitutes a privileged site through which to examine the development of such a choreographic discipline on the African continent, from both political and artistic perspectives. Based on an analysis of the French Ministry of Cooperation’s records, in-depth interviews with professionals and artists involved in the festival and the ethnography of two festival editions, this paper reveals how Western institutions have left their mark on the production of African contemporary dance. Drawing on Bourdieu’s theory of the ‘field’, I argue that, to conquer the international market, dancers have to connect the dominant and legitimate aesthetic currents of the field of contemporary dance that were created in the West with the staging of an urban African identity, in order to distinguish themselves in this very competitive art field. The effect of this, I show, is that African dancers were at times the anonymous instruments of the renewal of French contemporary dance. © 2016 Journal of African Cultural Studies","Africa; art field; Contemporary dance; cultural cooperation; festival",,2-s2.0-85006241138

There have been multiple studies on achieving the good trade-offs between QoS and energy to enhance the user experience, however, they generally lack a comprehensive and accurate understanding of QoS, and ignore the fact that each individual user has his/her own preference between QoS and energy. In this study, we overcome these two drawbacks and propose a customized power management policy that dynamically configures the mobile platform to achieve the user-specific optimal QoS and energy trade-offs and hence, satisfy each individual mobile user. We first introduce a novel and comprehensive definition of QoS, and propose the accurate QoS measurement and management methodologies. We then observe that user's personality greatly determines his/her preferences between QoS and energy, and propose an online personality-guided user satisfaction prediction model based on the QoS and energy, guided by the user personality inferred from his/her device usage history. Our validation proves our model can achieve very high prediction accuracy. Finally, we propose our customized power management policy based on the prediction model for individual users.

Achieving both high coverage and accuracy is particularly challenging in workloads with complex address patterns, which may require large amounts of history to accurately predict future addresses. This paper describes the Signature Path Prefetcher (SPP), which offers effective solutions for three classic challenges in prefetcher design. First, SPP uses a compressed history based scheme that accurately predicts complex address patterns. Second, unlike other history based algorithms, which miss out on many prefetching opportunities when address patterns make a transition between physical pages, SPP tracks complex patterns across physical page boundaries and continues prefetching as soon as they move to new pages. Finally, SPP uses the confidence it has in its predictions to adaptively throttle itself on a per-prefetch stream basis. In our analysis, we find that SPP improves performance by 27.2% over a no-prefetching baseline, and outperforms the state-of-The-Art Best Offset prefetcher by 6.4%. SPP does this with minimal overhead, operating strictly in the physical address space, and without requiring any additional processor core state, such as the PC. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Computer architecture; Complex pattern; Effective solution; Large amounts; Prefetches; Prefetching; Processor cores; State of the art; Physical addresses",2-s2.0-85009410511

This pre-execution results in prefetch requests that are overwhelmingly accurate (95% in a realistic system configuration for the memory intensive SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks), much more so than a global history buffer (GHB) or stream prefetcher (by 13%/19%). However, we also find that current runahead techniques are very limited in coverage: They prefetch only a small fraction (13%) of all runahead-reachable cache misses. This is because runahead intervals are short and limited by the duration of each full-window stall. In this work, we explore removing the constraints that lead to these short intervals. We dynamically filter the instruction stream to identify the chains of operations that cause the pipeline to stall. These operations are renamed to execute speculatively in a loop and are then migrated to a Continuous Runahead Engine (CRE), a shared multi-core accelerator located at the memory controller. The CRE runs ahead with the chain continuously, increasing prefetch coverage to 70% of runahead-reachable cache misses. The result is a 43.3% weighted speedup gain on a set of memory intensive quad-core workloads and a significant reduction in system energy consumption. This is a 21.9% performance gain over the Runahead Buffer, a state-of-The-Art runahead proposal and a 13.2%/13.5% gain over GHB/stream prefetching. When the CRE is combined with GHB prefetching, we observe a 23.5% gain over a baseline with GHB prefetching alone. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Chains; Computer architecture; Energy utilization; Hardware acceleration; Instruction streams; Memory controller; Performance Gain; Realistic systems; Runahead execution; State of the art; System energy consumption; Buffer storage",2-s2.0-85009380372

Sophisticated instruction prefetching techniques such as PIF [12] and RDIP [17] record the execution history of a program in dedicated hardware structures and use this information for prefetching if a known execution pattern is repeated. The storage overheads of the additional hardware structures are prohibitively high (64-200 KB per core). This makes it difficult for the deployment of such schemes in real systems. We propose a solution that uses minimal hardware modifications to tackle this problem. We notice that the execution of server applications keeps switching between tasks such as the application, system call handlers, and interrupt handlers. Each task has a distinct instruction footprint, and is separated by a special OS event. We propose a sophisticated technique to capture the instruction stream in the vicinity of such OS events; the captured information is then compressed significantly and is stored in a process's virtual address space. Special OS routines then use this information to prefetch instructions for the OS and the application codes. Using modest hardware support (4 registers per core), we report an increase in instruction throughput of 2-14% (mean: 7%) over state of the art instruction prefetching techniques for a suite of 8 popular OS intensive applications. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Computer architecture; Hardware; Information use; Virtual addresses; Dedicated hardware; Hardware modifications; Hardware structures; Instruction prefetching; Instruction streams; Pre-fetching scheme; Server applications; Virtual address space; Computer hardware",2-s2.0-85009374151

Brazilwood pigment lakes and orcein purple colours were unequivocally identified in illuminated manuscripts dated by art historians to be from the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries and in the Fernão Vaz Dourado Atlas (sixteenth century). All three works were on a parchment support. This was possible by combining Raman microscopy and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy with microspectrofluorimetry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that brazilein, the main chromophore in brazilwood lake pigments, has been unequivocally identified by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy in an illuminated work (the Dourado Atlas). Complementing this identification, through microspectrofluorimetry and micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, it was possible to propose a complete paint formulation by comparison with our database of references; the dark pink hues, in the three case studies, were produced by combining brazilwood pigment lakes and gypsum in a proteinand gum Arabic-based tempera.

The discovery of the remains of the Royal Navy warship HMS Swift off the coast of Patagonia, South America, which was wrecked in 1770 while undertaking a survey from its base in the Falkland/Malvinas Islands, has afforded the opportunity for a firstpass Raman spectroscopic study of the contents of several glass jars from a wooden chest, some of which had suffered deterioration of their contents owing to leakage through their stoppers. From the Raman spectroscopic data, it was possible to identify organic compounds such as anthraquinone and copal resin, which were empirically used as materia medica in the eighteenth century to treat shipboard diseases; it seems very likely, therefore, that the wooden chest belonged to the barber-surgeon on the ship. Spectra were obtained from the wet and desiccated samples, but several samples from containers that had leaked were found to contain only minerals, such as aragonite and sediment.

We tested whether a decoder could be made more robust to future neural variability by training it to handle a variety of recording conditions sampled from months of previously collected data as well as synthetic training data perturbations. We developed a new multiplicative recurrent neural network BMI decoder that successfully learned a large variety of neural-to-kinematic mappings and became more robust with larger training data sets. Here we demonstrate that when tested with a non-human primate preclinical BMI model, this decoder is robust under conditions that disabled a state-of-the-art Kalman filter-based decoder. These results validate a new BMI strategy in which accumulated data history are effectively harnessed, and may facilitate reliable BMI use by reducing decoder retraining downtime. ©The Author(s) 2016.",,"artificial neural network; brain; data interpretation; data set; interface; Kalman filter; machinery; nervous system; primate; training; adult; animal experiment; Article; brain computer interface; brain depth recording; brain mapping; computer simulation; controlled study; depth electrode; firing rate; learning; learning algorithm; male; nonhuman; visual feedback; Primates",2-s2.0-85006142676

However, most of these solutions are costly in term of processing, network overhead and latency as they mostly rely on cryptographic techniques and/or the generation of fake requests. Furthermore, all these solutions protect all queries similarly, ignoring whether the original request contains sensitive content (e.g., religious, political or sexual orientation) or not. Based on an analysis of a real dataset of Web search requests, we show that queries related to sensitive matters are in practice a minority. As a consequence, protecting all queries similarly results in poor performance as a large number of queries get overprotected. In this paper, we propose a request sensitivity assessment module that we use for improving the practicability of existing private web search solutions. We assess the sensitivity of a request in two phases: a semantic sensitivity analysis (based on the topic of the query) and a request linkability analysis (based on the similarity between the current query and the query history of the requester). Finally, the sensitivity assessment is used to adapt the level of protection of a given query according to its identified degree of sensitivity: the more sensitive a query is, the more protected it will be. Experiments with a real dataset show that our approach can improve the performance of state-of-the-arts private Web search solutions by reducing the number of queries overprotected, while ensuring a similar level of privacy to the users, making them more likely to be used in practice. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",,"Information retrieval; Middleware; Search engines; Semantics; Websites; Cryptographic techniques; Degree of sensitivity; Network overhead; Poor performance; Sexual orientations; State of the art; User privacy; Web searches; Sensitivity analysis",2-s2.0-85009889621

However, according to a recent study, 30% of VMs in data centers are not being used for any productive work. These ""inactive"" (or ""zombie"") VMs can arise from faulty VM management code within the cloud infrastructure but are usually the result of human neglect. Inactive VMs can hurt the performance of productive VMs, can distort internal cost management, and in the extreme can result in the cloud infrastructure being unable to allocate resources for new VMs. Correctly assessing the productivity of a VM can be challenging: e.g., is a VM that has low CPU utilization being used to slowly edit source code or is it an inactive VM that happens to be performing routine maintenance (e.g., virus-scan and software updates)? To address this problem, we develop a supervised learning model that leverages primitive information (e.g., running process, login history, network connections) of VMs periodically collected by a lightweight data collection framework. This model employs a linear support vector machine (SVM) approach that reflects single VM behavior as well as coordinated VM behaviors. We evaluated the identification accuracy of this model with a real-world dataset within IBM of more than 750 VMs. Results show that our model has a 20% higher accuracy (90%) than state-of-the-art approaches. An accurate model is an important first step to enable private cloud infrastructures to achieve better resource management through such actions as suspending or dynamically downsizing inactive VMs. © 2016 ACM.","Cloud computing; Data center management; IaaS garbage collection; Identifying inactive VMs; Supervised learning","Cloud computing; Middleware; Support vector machines; Viruses; Cloud infrastructures; Computing infrastructures; Data center management; Garbage collection; Identification accuracy; Identifying inactive VMs; Linear Support Vector Machines; State-of-the-art approach; Supervised learning",2-s2.0-85009830514

In discussions of the canon of art history, the notion of 'inclusiveness', both at the level of rhetoric and as a desired practice is on the rise and gradually replacing talk of 'exclusion', which dominated critiques of the canon up until two decades ago. The art field has dramatically, if insufficiently, changed in the half-century since the first protests and critiques of the exclusion of 'others' from the art canon. With increased globalization and shifting geopolitics, the art field is expanding beyond its Euro-American focus, as is particularly evident in the large-scale international biennales now held all over the globe. Are canons and counter-canons still relevant? Can they be re-envisioned rather than merely revised? Following an introduction that discusses these issues, thirteen newly commissioned essays present case studies of consecration in the contemporary art field, and three commissioned discussions present diverse positions on issues of the canon and consecration processes today. This volume will be of interest to instructors and students of contemporary art, art history, and museum and curatorial studies. © 2017 Ruth E.

Pedro IV and the artist Baptista Ribeiro was about to make history. Indeed, when Baptista Ribeiro delivered the prince a report on the need to create a public art museum in the city, the prince couldn't be happier. He then invited Baptista Ribeiro to organize it, giving all his support to the creation of the first public art museum in the nation.

I show that there were two major shifts in biological materialism that needed to occur before protoplasm theory could be elevated to have equal status with cell theory in the nineteenth century. First, I argue that biologists had to accept that life could inhere in matter alone, regardless of form. Second, I argue that in the 1840s, ideas of what formless, biological matter was capable of dramatically changed: going from a “coagulation paradigm” (Pickstone, 1973) that had existed since Theophrastus, to a more robust conception of matter that was itself capable of movement and self-maintenance. In addition to revisiting Schleiden and Schwann’s original writings on cell theory, this article looks especially closely at Hugo von Mohl’s definition of the protoplasm concept in 1846, how it differed from his primordial utricle theory of cell structure two years earlier. This article draws on Lakoff and Johnson’s theory of “ontological metaphors” to show that the cell, primordial utricle, and protoplasm can be understood as material container, object, and substance, and that these overlapping distinctions help explain the chaotic and confusing early history of cell theory. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Cambium; Cell; Coagulation; Matter; Primordial utricle; Protoplasm",,2-s2.0-85002213664

The reminiscing artists and the analysts are more or less at one declaring that ""three T's"" were ""created"" by György Aczél to describe the working of the art policy he dictated between 1957 and 1985. The matter is however far more complicated. First, the control of art policy was only partly in Aczél's hand at the beginning of the period, and at that time there was no trace of the ""three T's"", but at most two were experienced: banning and support. Secondly, Aczél's art policy was not solely his: the demarcation of his scope always fundamentally depended on the actual high political circumstances and on the party leaders who tried to hold them in sway. In the years of retaliation after the 1956 revolution between 1957 and 1962 the HSWP addressed all social groups including of course the artists from the position of power. For Aczél, it would have been in vain to add anything to the memorandum ""on the situation of our literature"" discussed by the party PC on August 6, 1957 as much as it was in vain to include that ""reserving the right of criticism, the party and the government (⋯) allow publicity to any non-realist trend that is not hostile to the people's democracy"" in the released resolution - that was not an indication of a ""tolerant"" art policy. This is massively proven by the ""guiding principles"" of the HSWP's ""cultural policy"" announced in the summer of 1958 which declared that ""the party will not put up with the fact that the inferior formalist products of bourgeois decadence (⋯) should pollute the taste of our people without inhibitions."" Consequently, the ""non-realist"" trends - though not hostile ""to the people's democracy"" did not have a say in literature or any other genre, including fine arts. Only the Ministry of Culture could have allowed them some scope, for the key to all publicity - in case of fine arts, the preliminary permission process for exhibitions - got into the hands of the art department of the ministry from autumn '57, but they had no intention to give room to artists creating abstract, surrealist, etc. works qualified as ""anti-humanist"". In the early sixties the grip of the dictatorship was loosened. In his closing address at the 8th congress of the HSWP János Kádár announced the slogan of the new times: ""Those who are not against us are with us."" In this relaxed atmosphere the ministry in charge of artistic matters was ready to make concessions. Small concessions, of course: they deemed it sufficient to give permission for four exhibitions a year in the smallest exhibiting room of Budapest for the representatives of ""artistic trends alien to our goals but not hostile in its contents"", provided that they were willing and able to cover all costs of the exhibitions from their pockets. The plan was thrashed out in detail. György Aczél consulted personally with the head of the cultural subsdivision of the HSWP László Szecsodi before the memorandum to be submitted to the party's Committee of Agitation and Propaganda. Yet the case did not reach the committee and in 1963 it was removed from the agenda. Notably because, in late 1962, the Soviet political leadership launched a campaign against all modern styles - not for the first or the last time - which the Hungarian decision-makers - who had enough trouble with the architects' viewpoint that they would not see any ""thematic works"" in their buildings - could not disregard. The case of the ""self-paid exhibitions"" came up again around the middle of the decade when preparations for the ""new economic mechanism"" to be launched in 1968 required the differentiation of the tools of a cultural policy that until then only knew of support and banning and the increased flexibility of allocating financial support, so they inserted the category of ""tolerable"" or ""permissible"" works between the supported and banned ones concerning public showing. Then on May 4, 1967 the ministry ordered the Lectorate of Fine and Applied Arts to insert in the schedule of exhibitions ""self-paid"" and ""semi-self-paid"" showings, and instructed the Kunsthalle to stage them in the Fényes Adolf gallery. The cost to be paid was 5000 and 2500 HUF, respectively. The first such exhibitions were opened in 1968. Not many such showings took place. There was no point. From the early sixties nearly all forbidden fruits - works by the classic and new generations of Hungarian avant-garde - were accessible at first in private homes, later in university clubs, culture houses, the Club of Young Artists, from 1963 in the most important venue, the King St Stephen Museum in Székesfehérvár and later in the Janus Pannonius Museum in Pécs. The paper whose preliminary writing was published in Muvészettörténeti Értesíto 2015/2 presents the archival sources of the above process in the appendix.","Banning; Fine arts 1957-1967; Minister György Aczél; Party control; Self-paid exhibitions; Supporting; Tolerating",,2-s2.0-85016415016

It was put together by combining the materials from two collections: the pharmaceutical-historical collection in Zagreb, which subsequently became the collection of the Institute for the History of Pharmacy, and the one of the Croatian Medical History Museum, which was established in 1944 within the Croatian Medical Association. During the 1960s, the Division for the History of Medical Sciences of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts took over the materials from both museums. Croatian Museum of Medicine and Pharmacy was officially established by the decision of the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Croatia issued on 7 July 2014. The mission of the Museum is documentation and promotion of Croatian biomedical sciences and practice based on material and immaterial heritage; as well as continued cooperation with Croatian medical and pharmaceutical institutions and companies. Since the establishment of the Museum, many donations have contributed to the enrichment of its holdings. The concept of arranging the standing museum holdings is being prepared, and plans exist to apply for financing the project for Museum premises.

Ward's oeuvre here is viewed through his sustained ambivalence toward the commercialization of the arts, both in his texts and his work as a publisher. His critical erasure is as much a function of modernist scholarship's continued irresolution toward the relationship between high art and popular culture as it is of the singularly hybrid status of his texts. Seen through the lens of comics studies, author/artists like Ward reside in a place at the intersection of literature and the fine arts, allowing us to reimagine many of the critical commonplaces of modernist scholarship.","Lynd Ward / graphic narrative / novels in woodcuts / comics / modernism",,2-s2.0-84964831292

A primary aim was to engage nursing students and educators in a project that valued nursing history by integrating it into an event to celebrate International Nurses Day. As the paper will explain, other aims were in organising the event so that it capitalised on particular creative arts strengths within the faculty, offering cross-disciplinary connections, engagement and appreciation. A Readers' Theatre event, involving academics and students in nursing, creative arts and education, was conceived, developed and performed for the community. The theme was the experiences of First World War nurses and how they encapsulated values important to nursing today – the 6 Cs – which guide high standards of nursing. The 6 Cs are care, compassion, competence, communication, courage and commitment. We called the Readers' Theatre “The Courage to Care”, and this involved a 4 month process of script development, event planning and a performance.

Carved by the Venetian workmen on pear tree boards, the woodblocks were used in the Basel printing of Vesalius’ works De Humani Corporis Fabrica and Epitome from 1543, The China Root Epistle (1546), and the frontispiece of the Fabrica, the edition from 1555. The blocks remained with the printer Oporinus in Basel until his death in 1568 when they were sold to the Froben family. The woodblocks reappeared in 1706 in a publication by Maschenbauer and were subsequently used by Leveling in 1783. An incomplete set of woodblocks was moved from Inglostadt to Landshut and then to Munich where Roth in 1885 documented them. At the suggestion of an American physician, Samuel Lambert, the University of Munich found the ""missing"" woodblocks in the attic. This led Wiegand and the New York Academy of Medicine to publish the woodblocks in the Icones Anatomicae in 1934. The second edition frontispiece was returned to Louvain where it was destroyed by bombing in 1940 and all the remaining woodblocks were destroyed in Allied bombing between 1943 and 1945. Thus, the Vesalius woodblocks travelled a 400-year journey from their creation, through the use in eight publications with over 5000 prints and ended in their tragic destruction. © 2016, Croatian Scientific Society for the History of Health.

The Jewish cousins immigrated separately to Boston from Lithuania in 1875 and 1882. One cousin, later calling himself simply B.B., became a world-renowned art historian. The other Bernard became a misanthrope after feeling deeply humiliated by his cousin's family in Boston. Many biographies were written about the famous B.B. The only histories of his cousin Bernard were family stories, as he was the author's great-grandfather. The intersecting lives of these cousins are discussed. Both men faced the challenges of immigration as well as intense anti-Semitism and prejudice in each country in which they lived. These cultural and historical conditions interacted with the cousins’ narcissistic vulnerabilities. Their lives demonstrate different manifestations of narcissistic suffering, with B.B's being more consistent with the construct of a “grandiose narcissist” and Bernard's being more consistent with that of a “closet narcissist.” The life stories of these two cousins with the same name offers an intriguing instance of a complicated relationship among immigration, prejudice, and narcissism and case examples of the manifestation of how narcissistic suffering can influence lives.

The purpose of this paper is to describe his role during the early history of the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine. Method: Based on documents from the Nobel Archive, this paper investigates how Czerny contributed, both as nominee and nominator, in shaping the early years of Nobel Prize history. Results: Vincenz Czerny was nominated at least three times for the Nobel Prize, but he was never selected. Czerny’s own nomination letters pinpoint important trends in medicine around the turn of the century. At least seven of the candidates he put forward, became Nobel Laureates. Conclusion: Czerny—like many other internationally renowned surgeons during the first decades of the twentieth century—missed out on the Nobel Prize, partly because it is not a lifetime award and his work would have to have been more recent. However, with his nominations, Czerny helped to shape the Nobel Prize to become the most important scientific award worldwide. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","History of surgery; Nobel Prize; Surgery; Vincenz Czerny","awards and prizes; cancer chemotherapy; cancer radiotherapy; cancer surgery; documentation; human; medical education; medical practice; priority journal; Review; surgeon; art; awards and prizes; general surgery; history; physiology; General Surgery; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; Humans; Nobel Prize; Physiology",2-s2.0-84989179768

They made early, significant and internationally recognized contribution into medical science and became eponymous, although social disasters of the twentieth century caused deep impact on their subsequent lives and careers, so their role was shadowed from global medical community. The article analyzes biographies and academic achievements of A-F.K. Siewert (aka: Zivert, Ziwert, von Siewert) (1872-1922), known for first description of the hereditary dyskinesia of cilia (as a triad of: situs inversus of the viscera, abnormal frontal sinuses producing sinusitis and bronchiectasis); S.S. Abramov (1875-1951), discoverer of primary idiopathic myocarditis, and N.I. Taratynov (1887-1919), who was the first in description of a local form of histiocytosis X (solitary eosinophilic granuloma) and predicted the eosinophilic origin of Charcot-Leyden crystals. The contribution of these scientists into Medicine is reviewed in context of historical epoch, on background of their different individual social choices and the fate of their families. Besides their eponymous descriptions, other medical priorities of these scholars are analyzed. Some previously unpublished materials from their family archives are presented, which witness for possible existence of unknown prototype for the main hero of 'Doctor Zhivago' novel by B.L. Pasternak and for probable priorities of doctor Zivert - in active diastole concept, or doctor Abramov - in description of dilated cardiomyopathy. The factors facilitating rapid development of theoretical and practical Medicine in imperial Russia of late XIX - early XX centuries are discussed.

Examples of mobile art — made of stone, bone, antler, ivory or clay — are often found as weathered fragments with surface wear that makes the reading of these objects difficult. Since the 19th century, archaeologists have used photography, direct tracing, and oblique light to decipher the marks of the artists. Modern tools and techniques for analysis have continued to evolve. Since the early 1980s, optical and electron microscopy have been used in the analysis of the finest traces. From the 1990s on, 3D laser scanning (30 years after its invention) has been used in all fields of archaeological research. Many techniques followed, quickly evolving. Today, we face an explosion of the techniques in the field, which offer more and more precision and rapidity that can be useful in archaeological research if applied in the service of well-reasoned lines of inquiry. This study focuses on two engraved bones from the Magdalenian period. The main aim of the study was to understand the objects, their history and role in the prehistoric context, and their means of production. Ultimately this study informed the conservation, handling, and interpretation of the objects in the museum environment. A secondary result of the study is an evaluation of the means of analysis in research on cultural heritage. Over the years many objects have been the subject of high-resolution digital photography, infrared photography, ultra-violet photography, RTI, digital microscopy, and microtopographical scans based on axial chromatism. The feedback of our experience of ten years of 3D approaches provides insight into the evolution of devices and software, and indicates which innovations are of the most value to the field of archaeological study and how their use in combination may yield optimal results. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","3D scanning; Archaeoscience; Digital microscopy; Engravings; Mobile art; Paleolithic; Technology",,2-s2.0-84973883054

With several extant prescriptions and esoteric methods of treating diseases alone, it is impossible to gauge in depth the management of medicine during this period. If one exception were to be cited, that would be the fact that the annotations for understanding the contents on Indian medicine in the ""Chapter on Eliminating Disease"" in the Sutra of Golden Light, a Buddhist sutra originating from India, reflected the medical knowledge of Buddhist monks from Silla (57 BC-935 AD) who were active immediately after the nation's unification of the two other kingdoms on the Korean Peninsula (668 AD) such as Wonhyo (617-686 AD), Gyeongheung (620?-700? AD), and Seungjang (684-? AD). Along with those by other monks, these annotations are collected in the Mysterious Pivot of the Sutra of Golden Light, which was compiled by Gangyō (835-871 AD), a Japanese monk from the Heian era (794-1185 AD). Representative versions of the ""Chapter on Eliminating Disease"" in the Sutra of Golden Light include: a classical Chinese translation by the Indian monk Dharmaksema (85-433 AD); the eight-volume edition by Chinese monk Baogui, which differs little from the preceding work in terms of the contents of the ""Chapter on Eliminating Disease""; and the ten-volume edition by Yijing (635-713 AD), who had full-fledged knowledge of Indian medicine. When the contents of the annotations thus collected are examined, it seems that Wonhyo had not been aware of the existence of the ten-volume edition, and Gyeongheung and Seungjang most certainly used the ten-volume edition in their annotations as well. Especially noteworthy are Wonhyo's annotations on the Indian medical knowledge found in the ""Chapter on Eliminating Disease"" in the Sutra of Golden Light. Here, he made a bold attempt to link and understand consistently even discussions on Indian and Buddhist medicine on the basis of the traditional East Asian medical theory centering on the yin-yang and five phases (wuxing). In accordance with East Asia's theory of the seasonal five phases, Wonhyo sought to explain aspects of Indian medicine, e.g., changes in the four great elements (catvari mahabhūtāni) of earth, water, fire, and wind according to seasonal factors and their effect on the internal organs; patterns of diseases such as wind (vāta)-induced disease, bile (pitta)-induced disease, phlegm (ślesman)-induced disease, and a combination (samnipāta) of these three types of diseases; pathogenesis due to the indigestion of food, as pathological mechanisms centering on the theory of the mutual overcoming (xiangke) of the five phases including the five viscera (wuzang), five flavors (wuwei), and five colors (wuse). They existed in the text contents on Indian medicine, which could not be explicated well with the existing medical knowledge based on the theory of the five phases. Consequently, he boldly modified the theory of the five phases in his own way for such passages, thus attempting a reconciliation, or harmonization of disputes (hwajaeng), of the two medical systems. Such an attempt was even bolder than those by earlier annotators, and Wonhyo's annotations came to be accepted by later annotators as one persuasive explanation as well. In the case of Gyeongheung and Seungjang, who obtained and examined the ten-volume edition, a new classical Chinese translation produced following Wonhyo's death, annotated the ""Chapter on Eliminating Disease"" based on their outstanding proficiency in Sanskrit and knowledge of new Indian and Buddhist medicine. This fact signifies that knowledge of the eight arts of Ayurvedic medicine in India was introduced into Silla around the early 8th century. The medical knowledge of Wonhyo, Gyeongheung, and Seungjang demonstrates that intellectual circles in contemporary Silla were arenas in which not only traditional East Asian medicine as represented by works such as the Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor (Huangdi Neijing) but also Indian medicine of Buddhism coexisted in almost real time. © The Korean Society for the History of Medicine.","Chapter on Eliminating Disease; Gyeongheung; Medicine in Shilla dynasty; Seungjang; Sutra of Golden Light; Traditional Korean medicine; Wonhyo","Buddhism; disease eradication; history; Korea; Korean medicine; monk; publication; Buddhism; Disease Eradication; History, Ancient; History, Medieval; Korea; Manuscripts, Medical; Medicine, Korean Traditional; Monks",2-s2.0-85017036231

The Kneipp Cure rested on five main tenets: hydrotherapy, exercise, nutrition, herbalism, and the balance of mind and body. This study illuminates the reception of the Kneipp Cure in the context of the trilateral relationship among the Kneipp Cure, the Natural Cure Movement in general, and modern medicine. The Natural Cure Movement was ideologically based on naturalism, criticizing industrialization and urbanization. There existed various theories and methods in it, yet they shared holism and vitalism as common factors. The Natural Cure Movement of Germany began in the early 19th century. During the late 19th century and the early 20th century, it became merged in the Lebensreformbewegung (life reform movement) which campaigned for temperance, anti-tobacco, and anti-vaccination. The core of the Natural Cure Movement was to advocate the world view that nature should be respected and to recognize the natural healing powers of sunlight, air, water, etc. Among varied natural therapies, hydrotherapy spread out through the activities of some medical doctors and amateur healers such as Johann Siegmund Hahn and Vincenz Prießnitz. Later, the supporters of hydrotherapy gathered together under the German Society of Naturopathy. Sebastian Kneipp, one of the forefathers of hydrotherapy, is distinguished from other proponents of natural therapies in two aspects. First, he did not refuse to employ vaccination and medication. Second, he sought to be recognized by the medical world through cooperating with medical doctors who supported his treatment. As a result, the Kneipp cure was able to be gradually accepted into the medical world despite the ""quackery"" controversy between modern medicine and the Natural Cure Movement. Nowadays, the name of Sebastian Kneipp remains deeply engraved on the memories of German people through various Kneipp spa products, as well as his books such as My Water Cure and Thus Shalt Thou LiVe/Wörishofen, where Kneipp had served as catholic priest as well as hydrotherapist for 42 years from 1855, changed its name to ""Bad Wörishofen"" (""Wörishofen Spa"" in German). The Kneipp Cure and the Natural Cure Movement became a source of ecologica l thought which is currently gaining more and more sympathy from German people. It is regarded as a lieu de mémoire (site of memory) reflecting the collective identity of German people. © The Korean Society for the History of Medicine.","Bad wörishofen; Hydrotherapy; Lebensreformbewegung (life reform movement); Lieu de mémoire (site of memory); Modern medicine; Naturalism; Quackery; Sebastian kneipp; The kneipp cure; The natural cure movement","alternative medicine; art; clergy; Germany; history; human; hydrotherapy; physician; Clergy; Germany; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; Humans; Hydrotherapy; Naturopathy; Physicians",2-s2.0-85017017001

However, our recent research has determined that the original observation by Traube was published in 1864 and does not in fact describe what is currently recognized as SD. It appears that many clinics throughout Europe and North America were investigating and publishing observations on a range of voice disorders. Methods: The wider context of work on laryngeal disorders in the 1860s-1870s is considered. One of Traube's contemporaries, Morell Mackenzie, made significant contributions to the understanding of laryngeal movement disorder and its consequences for the voice. These will be examined to gain a clearer focus on the characterization of this disorder. Results: The clinical descriptions published by Morrell Mackenzie in the 1860s provide details that conform quite closely to our current-day understanding of SD. Conclusions: The citation of Traube's ""hysterical"" patient links to mid 20th-century views of the functional nature of SD and the utility of psychiatric treatment. The description presented by Mackenzie is consistent with current views of SD as a movement disorder. © The Author(s) 2016..","19th-century history of medicine; dysphonia; movement disorders; spasmodic dystonia; vocal cord dysfunction; voice disorders","Conference Paper; Europe; human; North America; priority journal; publishing; spasmodic dysphonia; voice; voice disorder; art; dysphonia; history; laryngoscope; laryngoscopy; Dysphonia; History, 19th Century; Laryngoscopes; Laryngoscopy",2-s2.0-84994631060

Árkay bertalan horton (1954) és taksonyban (1958) épült templomainak építéstörténetei és tervei]",2016,"Muveszettorteneti Ertesito",,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016443242&partnerID=40&md5=2a14e4e4b826534ec7bd2a52227c7b9e","Bertalan Árkay's church in Budapest-Városmajor is the advent of modern Hungarian church architecture. He designed several churches after 1945, which are far less known or their evaluation is somewhat one-sided. This paper discusses the building history and surviving plan documentation of two of the fifteen churches built between 1945 and 1970. These churches are known to some extent from special literature. To learn the building history of the churches of Hort and Taksony I studied the documents of the parishes and the State Office for Church Affairs, as well as the relevant articles in the ecclesiastic media of the time. I examined the Árkay estate in the Architectural Collection of the Kiscell Museum of the Budapest History Museum to find the plans. 27 plans of the Hort church - of them 11 of the furnishing - and 35 of Taksony (only the building) survive. The historical inquiry reveals that while literature on ecclesiastic art registers both churches, art history only keeps tabs on the Taksony church. Experts on church art regard the Hort church as the continuation of pre-war modern architecture and judge the Taksony church as a formal experiment. Art historiography agrees that the Taksony church embodies a shift from the traditional church form. The church in Hort has a nave and side aisles, with basilical lighting and a flat chancel termination. The decisive features of the façade of Mátra stone are the projecting nave section and the pair of hip roofed towers. Its previous church built in the 18th century was blown up by the Germans in 1944. The construction of the new one began in 1946. The parish priest, Father Imre Mahunka wanted to build a pilgrimage church, but his archbishop Gyula Czapik warned him of the post-war financial difficulties, urging him to have a smaller church built. They began building a culture home, hoping to raise money from its revenues to finance a new church. With the aggravation of the historical-political circumstances in 1947-48, the ongoing construction was modified for a church. Plans by Bertalan Árkay are known from 1947, and data of 1949 verify that he joined the construction. As a result of the cooperation of the local craftsmen Árkay supervised and the artisans (fitter, glazier, stone carver) he had brought from the capital as well as the local population, of their immense work and financial sacrifice, the church was consecrated in 1954. The other tower was built in 1957 and the church was completed in 1960. The history of construction testifies to Árkay's practice as architect and site engineer: he entrusted all major work to master craftsmen he knew. The building history invalidates the conjectures that the church must have been built at the former's place and in the same size, but without a tower. The plans of the Hort church divide into four groups: dated 1947, dated 1949/50, undated, and furnishing plans. The plans of 1947 show the current state with minor alterations. The drawings of 1949 are architectural perspectives and detail drawings of the former. The undated sheets show the facade with more or less of the same overall mass as today, with different solutions in the details. The triple apertures up until the top quarter of the pair of towers can be found in all drawings, but in one the nave has a flat roof, the upper row of seven short and wide semicircular windows running from edge to edge. The top quarter of the towers displays four tiers of three thin and short semicircular windows in each tier. Furnishing drawings belong to the altars, gate lattice, baptismal font and the collecting box. Several details of the church (ceiling, gate, pieces of equipment) were realized after other plans in the estate. The complex mass of the Taksony church comprises a block on an elliptical floorplan covered with a shallow dome, a servicing section adjusted to the arc of the nave at a narrow side and opposite to it a tall prismatic entrance section on an oblong plan, divided vertically into three parts and attached to the nave with a passageway. Its earlier church was completed in 1811 but in WW2 it was badly damaged. Financial and historical difficulties pro-longed its repairs until the winter of 1955, but the earthquake of January 1956 caused the dome to collapse and the church became unfit for use. Lots of houses and several churches in the vicinity were also seriously damaged, so a nationwide fund raising started also using the church and the catholic media for the rebuilding of the Taksony church. The parish received considerable support from the state as well. The new church was built closer to the town centre. The church was planned by Bertalan Árkay, the dome by Pál Csonka. Construction lasted from April 1957 till July 1958, built wholly by the craftsmen contracted by the architect and the construction engineer. The clerical press emphasized that the country's most modern church had been built here in which up-to-date pastorate could also be realized. The chairs like cinema seats were completed in 1961, the aluminium cover of the dome was ready in 1961 and the statue of Christ was installed on the façade in 1972. Each sheet of the plan documentation of the Taksony church is dated 1956-1957, 31 out of the 35 plans showing variants of the floorplan, elevation and façade. The rich set of plans reveal that Bertalan Árkay's imagination was inspired by the possibility to design a church of novel space formation. He envisioned a wide variety of solutions from a simple rotunda to a complex ensemble consisting of church, tower, servicing sections and arcade, from the undivided gable with rose window to an entrance section on an oval plan with openwork façade. This series of plans is unparalleled in his post-1945 church architecture, and there is only a single example in his oeuvre that somewhat resembles this church on an elliptic floorplan. It is the set of drawings entitled Böszörményi road cinema (Csörsz cinema) and highrise in which a building on an oval plan appears with an accentuated entrance edifice and across from it a curved extension. In his earlier career Bertalan Árkay turned so radically away from traditional church models as in Taksony only once: in the Városmajor church, so it is worth exploring what might have been the possible sources of inspiration. In this paper a single book is looked at closely in this regard, which was not only written at the time of the building of the Városmajor church but it also analyses it in detail, hence it must have been known to Árkay. Among the examples the author Antal Somogyi adduces, a photo of the Frauenfriedeskirche (1927-1929) in Frankfurt designed by Hans Herkommer (1887-1956) elicits associations with one of the variations of the Hort church façade, while Clemens Holzmeister's (1886-1983) church in Maria Grün reminds the reader of the Taksony curch layout and domed ceiling. Somogyi was of the opinion that arched roofs would come to the fore again in modern architecture. Apparently, Árkay thought in 1956 that the primacy of angular forms and linerality had declined. The art historical evaluation of the Hort and Taksony churches is based on a stylistic approach and it deals with the formal innovations of modern architecture on buildings whose function and clients both demanded the observation of tradition. Comparing the churches built in Hungary between 1945 and 1970 with those built in Rome in this period, one finds that the traditional floor plans and façade solutions were predominant there too, but some with domed roofs and oval floor plans were also built. In this context it ought to be revised whether it is sensible to separate modern architecture and modern church architecture, and Bertalan Árkay's churches ought to be revaluated.","Antal Somogyi; Bertalan Árkay; Central floor; Church; Church art; Church planning; Elliptic dome; László Csaba; Modern church architecture; Modernity; Post-1945 period; Tower",,2-s2.0-85016443242

Material and methods: Four collections were analyzed: the Magdalenian assemblage from Gough's Cave (UK) and the Mesolithic-Neolithic bone samples from Lepenski Vir, Padina and Vlasac (Serbia). A total of 647 cut marks (345 on human and 302 on non-human remains) were imaged and measured using an optical surface measurement system, the Alicona InfiniteFocus, housed at the Natural History Museum (London, UK). Results: The frequency of cut marks at Gough's Cave exceeds 65%, while it is below 1% in the Serbian sites, and no human tooth marks and only one case of percussion damage have been observed on the three Serbian collections. The distribution of cut marks on human bones is comparable in the four assemblages. Cannibalized human remains, however, present a uniform cut mark distribution, which can be associated with disarticulation of persistent and labile articulations, and the scalping and filleting of muscles. For secondary burials where modification occurred after a period of decay, disarticulation marks are less common and the disarticulation of labile joints is rare. The micromorphometric analyses of cut marks on human and non-human remains suggest that cut marks produced when cleaning partially decayed bodies are significantly different from cut marks produced during butchery of fresh bodies. Conclusions: A distinction between cannibalism and secondary treatment of human bodies can be made based on frequency, distribution and micromorphometric characteristics of cut marks. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","breakage damage; cut marks; human tooth marks; Magdalenian; Mesolithic","art; bone; cannibalism; cleaning; disarticulation; England; history; human; human experiment; human versus animal comparison; information center; joint; Mesolithic; muscle; Neolithic; percussion; posthumous care; ritual; Serbia; tooth; animal; bone; cannibalism; deer; diet; feeding behavior; pathology; physical anthropology; rabbits and hares; technology; Animals; Anthropology, Physical; Bone and Bones; Cannibalism; Deer; Diet; England; Feeding Behavior; History, Ancient; Humans; Rabbits; Serbia; Technology",2-s2.0-84983390696

We note that, as in every period of history, Paleolithic art can be seen as embedded in the society that studies it. Over the last 20 years, the research attention given to women in Paleolithic societies has grown considerably, leading us to ask what could have been the roles of women in Paleolithic art. On what criteria could we base a determination of those roles or of other social identities that were likely part of the making and viewing of Paleolithic art? Thanks to our microscopic analysis of engravings, it is possible to identify the skill level and expertise of the artists and thus to address the question of apprenticeship and how these techniques were transmitted. We observe many similarities that allow us to group together various works of art, sometimes from very distant sites, which indicate a movement of ideas, objects, and people.

The pathophysiology is only incompletely understood. Multiorgan involvement correlates with high relapse rates, high serum IgG4 levels and an aggressive disease course, which is why diagnostics and therapy must be carried out rapidly and efficiently according to international guidelines despite all the difficulties. Standard treatment: Currently the therapeutic standard is initial therapy (induction therapy) with glucocorticosteroids over a longer period of time and if necessary followed by low-dose maintenance therapy. Steroids are also the first choice therapy for management of relapses. Refractory disease courses are a rare but relevant problem. Treatment innovations: The B‑cell depleting antibody rituximab has shown excellent results in terms of remission induction and also maintenance therapy. The good effectiveness profile is likely to change the current treatment regimen for IgG4-related diseases in the future. Diagnostic work-up: The current diagnostic algorithms applicable for several organ systems are based on four major pillars: (i) patient history and physical examination, (ii) serological diagnostics, (iii) organ swelling in the appropriately selected imaging procedure and (iv) the histological picture as gold standard. Performance: The currently used algorithms allow a diagnosis to be made in most cases. Achievements: IgG4-related diseases are a relevant differential diagnosis, particularly of malignant diseases. It is often a diagnosis by exclusion. An interdisciplinary approach is essential for rapid diagnostics and induction of therapy. Practical recommendations: In Europe IgG4 serum levels are just one of several diagnostic criteria.

Key questions remain unanswered, including the role of HIV infection and replication in disease development and the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the prevention and treatment of disease.METHODS: In this multicentre study, we describe the renal pathology of HIVICK and compare the clinical characteristics of patients with HIVICK with those with IgA nephropathy and HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). Poisson regression models were used to identify risk factors for each of these pathologies.RESULTS: Between 1998 and 2012, 65 patients were diagnosed with HIVICK, 27 with IgA nephropathy and 70 with HIVAN. Black ethnicity and HIV RNA were associated with HIVICK, receipt of ART with IgA nephropathy and black ethnicity and CD4 cell count with HIVAN. HIVICK was associated with lower rates of progression to end-stage kidney disease compared with HIVAN and IgA nephropathy (P < 0.0001). Patients with HIVICK who initiated ART and achieved suppression of HIV RNA experienced improvements in estimated glomerular filtration rate and proteinuria.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a pathogenic role for HIV replication in the development of HIVICK and that ART may improve kidney function in patients who have detectable HIV RNA at the time of HIVICK diagnosis. Our data also suggest that IgA nephropathy should be viewed as a separate entity and not included in the HIVICK spectrum. © The Author 2016.

This incommensurability is reproduced through a series of semiotic processes described here: first, an historical shift in the vocabulary for everyday things, in which marked foreignness is replaced by marked Chineseness, and reflections on that history in contemporary film; second, traditionalist performances of resistance to (and repugnance for) Western aesthetics, accompanied by a tendency to deploy markedly Chinese objects as emblems of cultural allegiance; and third, an artist's lecture on the perplexity of negotiating this incommensurability in art practice.

We define hierarchical equivalence classes by tying certain models at a hierarchy level in a recursive manner in order to mitigate undertraining problems. These equivalence classes defined on a hierarchical structure are then used to construct a super exponential number of sequential FS predictors based on their combinations and permutations. We then introduce truly sequential algorithms with computational complexity only linear in the pattern length that 1) asymptotically achieve the performance of the best FS predictor or the best linear combination of all the FS predictors in an individual sequence manner without any stochastic assumptions over any data length n under a wide range of loss functions; 2) achieve the mean square error of the best linear combination of all FS filters or predictors in the steady-state for certain nonstationary models.

Drawing on the work of Garry Marvin, Sam Alberti and Merle Patchett, this article stalks Powell-Cotton’s taxidermic project across various sites of capture, production and display (what I call necrogeographies) to illuminate the sinuous contours of imperial natural history and the stories of pursuit, production and performance lurking beneath the skin of the reanimated animal. © 2016 The Authors History published by The Historical Association and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"art; hunting; preservation; ungulate; Chatham; England; Medway; United Kingdom; Animalia; Gossypium hirsutum; Rhinoceros",2-s2.0-85006985828

Aspects of aristocratic culture in Alpine Lombardy at the end of the Middle Ages",2016,"Quaderni Storici",,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019695873&doi=10.1408%2f86405&partnerID=40&md5=8471390f8605a9617e308f689bd84b29","The aim of this essay is to discuss the role of chivalric culture at the end of the Middle Ages in Italian aristocratic identity, which scholars have recently revalued in the period of so-called courtly or urban civilization. The research focuses on an area that was slightly conditioned by court and city culture: The Alpine valleys of Lombardy. The status symbols analyzed are the housing styles and frescos inspired by history and literature. What emerges is surely the long-lived adhesion of the first rank of the aristocracy to military fantasy, exhibited in fortified houses and themes of hunting and warfare for their decoration. On the other hand, palaces and paintings are not static and mechanical manifestations of a fixed social eminence. Our approach is the social history of artistic works, in other words the microanalysis of the commission context, rather than a stylistic or a merely cultural interpretation. Many social actors (nobles, upstarts, communities, the states of Milan and Venice) were in competition for the power of using violence and of setting up structures of defense, like the fragmented jurisdiction over the Locarno castle demonstrates. This perspective allows us to reconstruct a field of aesthetic competition, rather than a mere aesthetic evolution, and to nuance some of its social implications. For example, when the state control of military structures grew and even middle-class men were enabled to inhabit a tower, the most powerful lords of the area (the Beccaria of Sondrio) chose to maintain their stately castle, but other families preferred to transform a fortified habitation into a sumptuous Renaissance villa, the new modish sign of distinction, or to live in a town building.","Fortified architecture; Lordship; Orlando furioso; Renaissance art commission; Social representations",,2-s2.0-85019695873

While paleoIndian sites like Monte Verde in Chile, or Guitarrero Cave in Peru, are located near the pacific coast, Monte Alegre lies much further inland, 680 km upriver from the mouth of the Amazon River and the Atlantic Coast. With excavated wood charcoal radiocarbon dated as early as 13,200 calibrated years ago, the hillas a source of sandstone and quartz lithicssupplied early pioneers with adequate tools needed for colonizing the interior of the continent. Once there, they painted rock art on the landscape, which bears a record of the sun's horizon positions throughout the year. At just 2south of the equator, Monte Alegre shows no overt seasonal changes beyond fluctuating rainfall amounts, unlike at higher latitudes where temperature, amount of daylight, foliage, and forms of precipitation markedly change. Near the equator, solar and stellar horizon sightings most visibly track the passage of time and seasonal cycles. However, horizons are often hidden behind high forest canopy throughout much of the Amazon Rainforest; but in the Monte Alegre hill ridges looming above the river, paleoIndians could hike above the canopy to peer at the horizon, more effectively synchronizing their activities to ecological cycles. This research suggests that Monte Alegre paleoIndians delimited the azimuthal range of the sun in a solar year with notational pictographs aligned to horizon sightings at Painel do Pilão, and leaving a painted grid of tally marks that might have served as a rudimentary early calendar. The broad-reaching implication for early Americans is that through the strategic placement of rock art, these ancient artists fostered predictive archaeorecording from which resources could be optimally extracted, ceremonial activities could be consistently scheduled, and gatherings for social and economic exchange could be more efficiently coordinated. © 2016 Christopher Sean Davis.

The use of arts-based strategies that employ a figure from history as a source of support to help improve the quality of life has not been documented.OBJECTIVE: The current limited study allowed the author the ability to use the materials in her book, If Joan of Arc Had Cancer: Finding Courage, Faith, and Healing From History's Most Inspirational Woman Warrior, to provide support to women who were cancer survivors and to see if the use of Joan of Arc as a healing guide would be relevant. The primary intention was to find out how the book would be received by women with cancer and also to have the opportunity to determine what was helpful and what was not useful for them.DESIGN: The study was a pilot study.SETTING: The study took place at the Gilda's Club, a national support community for people with cancer and their families, in Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA, one of the satellite programs sponsored by the Wellness Community.PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 10 female survivors of cancer who were members of the Gilda's Club.INTERVENTION: Participants took part in a 6-wk workshop. The workshop included arts-based medicine and meditations, based on a book written by the current author.OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants completed surveys both pre- and postintervention.RESULTS: The program had 10 participants, but only 3 women finished the 6-wk program and completed the postintervention survey. After the workshop, the 3 participants indicated in a survey that they were feeling less anxiety and fear and noted that they felt that they had an improved quality of life and felt more empowered with respect to their psychological frames of mind. In addition, when asked on the survey about the effectiveness of their communications with their physicians (ie, their ability to express and discuss their psychosocial and physical needs combined), they also indicated that they felt that their communications had improved.CONCLUSIONS: The current study, conducted with a small group of women who were cancer survivors, has shown that the use of arts-based medicine can be effective and, most particularly, that the use of Joan of Arc as a model for empowerment can be particularly effective.",,"alternative medicine; anxiety; behavior; fear; female; history; human; humanities; neoplasm; procedures; psychology; survivor; Anxiety; Fear; Female; History; Humanities; Humans; Mind-Body Therapies; Neoplasms; Power (Psychology); Survivors",2-s2.0-85020368213

Women with endometriosis are more likely to have difficulty conceiving and tend to receive infertility treatment, including assisted reproductive technology (ART) therapy. There has not yet been a prospective cohort study examining the effects of endometriosis on pregnancy outcome in pregnant Japanese women. Methodology: This was a prospective cohort study of the incidence of obstetrical complications in women with endometriosis using data of the Japan Environment & Children's Study (JECS). Included in this study were 9,186 pregnant women in the JECS with or without a history of endometriosis who gave birth or stillbirth or whose pregnancy was terminated with abortion between February and December 2011. Main Outcome Measures: The effects of endometriosis on pregnancy outcome. Results: Of the 9,186 pregnant women in the JECS, 4,119 (44.8%) had obstetrical complications; 330 participants reported a diagnosis of endometriosis before pregnancy, and these women were at higher risk for complications of pregnancy than those without a history of endometriosis (odds ratio (OR) = 1.50; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20 to 1.87). Logistic regression analyses showed that the adjusted OR for obstetrical complications of pregnant women who conceived naturally and had a history of endometriosis was 1.45 (CI 1.11 to 1.90). Among pregnant women with endometriosis, the ORs of preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PROM) and placenta previa were significantly higher compared with women never diagnosed with endometriosis who conceived naturally or conceived after infertility treatment, except for ART therapy (OR 2.14, CI 1.03±4.45 and OR 3.37, CI 1.32±8.65). Conclusions: This study showed that endometriosis significantly increased the incidence of preterm PROM and placenta previa after adjusting for confounding of the data by ART therapy.

However, using search engines raises serious privacy issues as the latter gather large amounts of data about individuals through their search queries. Two main techniques have been proposed to privately query search engines. A first category of approaches, called unlinkability, aims at disassociating the query and the identity of its requester. A second category of approaches, called indistinguishability, aims at hiding user’s queries or user’s interests by either obfuscating user’s queries, or forging new fake queries. This paper presents a study of the level of protection offered by three popular solutions: Tor-based, TrackMeNot, and GooPIR. For this purpose, we present an efficient and scalable attack – SimAttack – leveraging a similarity metric to capture the distance between preliminary information about the users (i.e., history of query) and a new query. SimAttack de-anonymizes up to 36.7 % of queries protected by an unlinkability solution (i.e., Tor-based), and identifies up to 45.3 and 51.6 % of queries protected by indistinguishability solutions (i.e., TrackMeNot and GooPIR, respectively). In addition, SimAttack de-anonymizes 6.7 % more queries than state-of-the-art attacks and dramatically improves the performance of the attack on TrackMeNot by 23.6 %, while retaining an execution time faster by two orders of magnitude. © 2016, Petit et al.","Indistinguishability; Privacy; Unlinkability; Web search","Data privacy; Information retrieval; Search engines; Websites; History of queries; Indistinguishability; Large amounts of data; Orders of magnitude; Preliminary information; Query search engines; Unlinkability; Web searches; World Wide Web",2-s2.0-84964253412

The emphasis on prevention as a viable and critical approach to decreasing cancer mortality has gained traction in recent years, evidenced by its inclusion in the US Vice President's Cancer Initiative (also termed ‘Moonshot’). Cancer prevention occurs by arresting, slowing down, or reversing the carcinogenic process before invasion into surrounding tissue or by avoiding or blocking causative exposure. An important challenge is to identify individuals who will benefit most from preventive interventions with the least possible harm. Preventive interventions range from avoiding known carcinogens (e.g., tobacco or asbestos) to intervening with anticarcinogenic strategies (behavioral modifications, such as diet and exercise; medications; nutritional agents; and vaccination against causative agents).

Patients and clinicians would benefit from information specific to donor embryo cycles to inform fertility treatment options, counselling, and clinical decision-making. Objective We sought to quantify trends in donor embryo cycles in the United States, to characterize donor embryo recipients, and to report transfer, pregnancy, and birth outcomes of donor embryo transfers. Study Design This retrospective cohort study of frozen donor embryo transfers uses data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National ART Surveillance System to quantify trends in the use of donor embryos and corresponding rates of pregnancy and live birth from 2000 through 2013. For 2007 through 2013, years reflective of current practice, rates of cancellation, pregnancy, miscarriage, live birth, singleton and twin live birth, and delivery of a full-term singleton infant of normal birthweight (≥37 weeks, ≥2500 g) are reported. Results Among all frozen transfers from 2000 through 2013 (n = 391,662), the annual number of donor embryo transfers increased significantly from 332-1374, however the proportion of donor embryo transfers among all frozen transfers did not change significantly (2.3-2.6%). Both overall pregnancy and live birth rates per frozen donor embryo transfer increased significantly (33.3-49.1% and 26.5-40.8%, respectively) (P <.01). Among all initiated donor embryo cycles from 2007 through 2013 (n = 7289), the overall cancellation rate prior to transfer was 7.1%. Among all transfers from 2007 through 2013 (n = 6773), 3193 (47.2%) resulted in pregnancy and 2589 (38.2%) resulted in a live birth. Among all pregnancies, 535 (16.9%) resulted in a miscarriage. Among all live births, 1929 (74.5%) delivered a singleton of which 1482 (76.8%) were full term and normal birthweight. Conclusion The increasing availability of donor embryos, low chance of cancellation, and increasing likelihood of achieving live birth can inform consumers and providers who are considering assisted reproductive technology options.

In this species, there are two distinct life histories: parental and cuckolder, encompassing three reproductive tactics, parental, satellite, and sneaker. The parental life history is fixed, whereas individuals who enter the cuckolder life history transition from sneaker to satellite tactic as they grow. For this study, we used RNAseq to characterize the brain transcriptome of the three male tactics and females during spawning to identify gene ontology (GO) categories and potential candidate genes associated with each tactic. We found that sneaker males had higher levels of gene expression differentiation compared to the other two male tactics. Sneaker males also had higher expression in ionotropic glutamate receptor genes, specifically AMPA receptors, compared to other males, which may be important for increased spatial working memory while attempting to cuckold parental males at their nests. Larger differences in gene expression also occurred among male tactics than between males and females. We found significant expression differences in several candidate genes that were previously identified in other species with ARTs and suggest a previously undescribed role for cAMP-responsive element modulator (crem) in influencing parental male behaviors during spawning. © 2016 Partridge et al.

Measures and rules regarding their application are stated in Statutes of Dalmatian communes dating from the 13th and the 14th centuries, as well as in late-Mediaeval and Early-modern archival material from the archives in Zadar, Dubrovnik and Kotor. They have moreover been preserved until today in squares or museums of Dalmatian towns and settlements. The author analyses and compares the preserved stone measures and their measuring values with Venetian measures of the same period, as well as with the results achieved in Croatian historical metrology, Croatian and European art history, and historiography. Particular stone carvings are not measures, but architectonic parts of buildings or churches - for instance in Zadar, Trogir and Korčula. The text is accompanied by figures, photographs of preserved measures, or drawings and layouts thereof.

In the past decade, scholars of information science have started to conduct research on information behaviour in serious leisure. Presently, these studies lack common concepts and terms and empirical discoveries are not easy to assemble into theory. Aim. This conceptual and methodological paper surveys the aforementioned research area and introduces Anders Hektor’s model of information behaviour in conjunction with the serious leisure perspective as a means to systematically study information behaviour in serious leisure. Method. Three methods are employed. The first is a selective literature review and intellectual history of research into information behaviour in serious leisure. The second is a conceptual analysis of Hektor’s model that relates its key features to the serious leisure perspective. The third consists of a deductive audit of three forms of serious leisure (the liberal arts hobby, amateur musicianship, and the hobby of running), utilising the frameworks, concepts, and terms outlined in the paper. Results. Studies of information behaviour in serious leisure have increased and deepened in the past decade, largely through idiographic case studies. Hektor’s model of information behaviour, with its locus in everyday life and precise delineation of eight information activities, can complement such research designs. A deductive audit guided by Hektor’s model illuminated information activities within the three forms of serious leisure and enabled comparative observations. Conclusions. When combined with the serious leisure perspective, Hektor’s model enables research that is comparative and more precise. However, the extent to which this model captures physical or embodied information should be further examined. © the authors, 2016.",,,2-s2.0-85006105931

Third, it highlights the way in which Medea instrumentalizes the history of East Asian performance art. Fourth, it argues that Medea is the outcome of a harmonious conceptual collaboration between Greek pathos, the so-called han of pansori, and the grotesque. Fifth, it hypothesizes that, at the culmination of the grotesque mood in Medea, the audience experiences a dramatic turn that is effective because it is in full accordance with the affective structure of pansori, a process defined herein as reflective catharsis.

Various intrauterine pathologies contribute to RIF. Nevertheless, vaginal sonography and hysterosalpingography, which are the common diagnostic tools for the initial follow-up, have limited sensitivities. In this context, we aimed to evaluate the impact of office hysteroscopy (oHS) on live birth rates (LBRs) when performed prior to subsequent ART cycles in women with a history of RIF. Material and Methods: The database of an assisted reproduction center was retrospectively reviewed to detect eligible cases. A total of 363 women out of 2875 admissions were consecutively included in the analysis, of which 119 formed the oHS group and 244 formed the non-oHS group prior to a new ART cycle. Women in the oHS arm were examined during their early follicular phase via a vaginoscopic approach 1-6 months before the beginning of a new cycle. The standard in-vitro fertilization-intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) cycle was applied to all the women. Results: In the oHS group (n=119), 61 patients had intrauterine abnormalities, with an overall abnormality rate of 51.2%. Implantation, pregnancy, and LBRs of the groups were statistically similar. LBRs of the women with abnormal oHS findings (15/61, 24.5%), with normal oHS findings (14/58, 24.1%), and without oHS (39/244, 16%) were statistically similar (p=0.41). Conclusion: Unrecognized intrauterine pathologies can be easily detected and concurrently treated during oHS with high success rate.

The development of the built environment involves not only art, technology, history, economics and law, but also philosophy, culture, medicine, psychology, sociology and many other spheres in which human life is manifested. However, only a relatively small number of disciplines such as spatial planning, urban design, urban planning, etc. (ignoring at this point the differences in the meaning of the concepts) in their application layer are meant to create space and bear responsibility for it. Also society has certain requirements of practical nature towards them.

The investigation found multifaceted perspectives on the merits of visually-impaired children being educated in either mainstream or special educational contexts. These related to matters such as access to specific learning opportunities, a lack of understanding of visually-impaired musicians' learning processes (including accessible technologies and score media) in mainstream contexts, and concerns about the knowledge of music educators in relation to visual impairment. Regarding pedagogy, there were challenges raised, but also helpful areas for sighted music educators to consider, such as differentiation by sight condition and approach, and the varying roles of gesture, language, light and touch. There was diversity in musical participation of visually-impaired adult learners, along with some surprising barriers as well as opportunities linked to different genres and musical contexts, particularly in relation to various print media, and sight reading. © SEMPRE.","blindness; Braille; disability; ear playing; partial sight; pedagogy; schooling; scores; visual impairment",,2-s2.0-85006340271

The aim of this study was to evaluate the survival of TB-HIV patients in a TB-referral center during a 10-year follow-up. Methods All TB-HIV patients in our referral center were enrolled in the study from 2003 to 2014, and patients were divided into two groups: HIV-TB patients without a history of TB treatment (new cases of TB) and HIV-TB patients with a history of TB treatment. Both groups were treated based on World Health Organization TB-treatment guidelines, and multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate risk factors of all-cause mortality. Results During the study, 22 HIV-TB patients with a history of TB treatment and 263 HIV-TB patients with newly diagnosed TB were included. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were similar, except that miliary TB (98% vs. 2%) and mortality (97% vs. 3%; p = 0.06) were more likely in HIV patients with newly diagnosed TB. During TB treatment and subsequent follow-up, two patients did not respond to treatment and 92 (32.3%) patients died, whereas the cure rate was 60%. Pneumothorax [hazard ratio (HR): 3.17], coinfection (herpes zoster, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus infection, Pneumocystis jiroveci, candidiasis, and other opportunistic infection; HR: 1.75), CD4 < 100 cells/mL (HR: 1.96), thrombocytopenia (HR: 2.29), and lack of treatment with antiretroviral agents (ART; HR: 2.82) were significantly associated with all-cause mortality according to multivariate analysis.

Gascoigne confronts, both in his poetic theory and in practice, the fact that the processes of writing and publication are themselves contingent; and his fictions offer us multiple explorations of the human challenges of making sense of chaotic and unpredictable circumstances. The essay shows that he does so in part by adopting a rich language of chance, suddenness and accident, engaging with ancient and early modern philosophical and practical discourses about art, intention, judgement and equity. The essay deals with the full range of Gascoigne’s eclectic output, but focuses especially on his pioneering miscellany, A Hundreth Sundrie Flowres (1573), arguing for a fortuitous resonance between that book’s own complex and rather accident-ridden printing history and the conceptual preoccupations of its contents.

However, the state-of-the-art treatment for EVD is limited to quarantine and supportive care. The 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, the largest in history, is believed to have caused more than 11,000 fatalities. The countries worst affected are also among the poorest in the world. Given the complexities, time, and resources required for a novel drug development, finding efficient drug discovery pathways is going to be crucial in the fight against future outbreaks. We have developed a Computational Analysis of Novel Drug Opportunities (CANDO) platform based on the hypothesis that drugs function by interacting with multiple protein targets to create a molecular interaction signature that can be exploited for rapid therapeutic repurposing and discovery. We used the CANDO platform to identify and rank FDA-approved drug candidates that bind and inhibit all proteins encoded by the genomes of five different Ebola virus strains. Top ranking drug candidates for EVD treatment generated by CANDO were compared to in vitro screening studies against Ebola virus-like particles (VLPs) by Kouznetsova et al. and genetically engineered Ebola virus and cell viability studies by Johansen et al. to identify drug overlaps between the in virtuale and in vitro studies as putative treatments for future EVD outbreaks. Our results indicate that integrating computational docking predictions on a proteomic scale with results from in vitro screening studies may be used to select and prioritize compounds for further in vivo and clinical testing. This approach will significantly reduce the lead time, risk, cost, and resources required to determine efficacious therapies against future EVD outbreaks.","Candock; Compound-proteome interaction; Drug repurposing and discovery; Multitarget docking",,2-s2.0-85002798929

Damage diagnostics and condition monitoring of such a turbomachinery system has become an increasingly important and powerful tool to prevent potential failure in components and reduce unplanned forced outage and further maintenance costs, while improving reliability, availability and maintainability of a turbomachinery system. This paper presents a probabilistic signal processing methodology for damage diagnostics using multiple time history data collected from different locations of a turbomachine, considering data uncertainty and multivariate correlation. The proposed methodology is based on the integration of three advanced state-of-the-art data mining techniques: discrete wavelet packet transform, Bayesian hypothesis testing, and probabilistic principal component analysis. The multiresolution wavelet analysis approach is employed to decompose a time series signal into different levels of wavelet coefficients. These coefficients represent multiple time-frequency resolutions of a signal. Bayesian hypothesis testing is then applied to each level of wavelet coefficient to remove possible imperfections. The ratio of posterior odds Bayesian approach provides a direct means to assess whether there is imperfection in the decomposed coefficients, thus avoiding over-denoising. Power spectral density estimated by the Welch method is utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of Bayesian wavelet cleansing method. Furthermore, the probabilistic principal component analysis approach is developed to reduce dimensionality of multiple time series and to address multivariate correlation and data uncertainty for damage diagnostics. The proposed methodology and generalized framework is demonstrated with a set of sensor data collected from a real-world centrifugal compressor with impeller cracks, through both time series and contour analyses of vibration signal and principal components. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Bayesian hypothesis testing; Damage diagnostics; Probabilistic PCA; Turbomachinery; Wavelet packet transform","Bayesian networks; Centrifugal compressors; Centrifugation; Condition monitoring; Cracks; Damage detection; Data mining; Impellers; Integration testing; Maintainability; Outages; Packet networks; Power spectral density; Signal processing; Spectral density; Statistical tests; Time series; Time series analysis; Turbomachinery; Uncertainty analysis; Vibration analysis; Wavelet analysis; Wavelet transforms; Bayesian hypothesis; Damage diagnostics; Discrete wavelet packet transforms; Multiresolution wavelet analysis; Probabilistic PCA; Probabilistic principal component analysis; Reliability , availability and maintainabilities; Wavelet packet transforms; Principal component analysis",2-s2.0-84992310135

With regard to the tension between the pluralism ofvarious modes of interpretation and a Biblicism neglecting the value of historical approaches, the contribution of Hans-Georg Gadamer deserves again proper attention. His Hermeneutics shows that the intermediation of truth takes place even independently from certain methods, e. g. in the art. There is a right to the truth that limits the exclusive claim of sciences. At the same time, however, historical and philological work is essential to clarify the conditions and the horizons of understanding in order to reach a deeper understanding of the truth. No object or matter exists without a history of reception, which also influences its understanding. Each object, each matter modifies the interpreter.

This paper presents SalesExplorer, a new recommendation algorithm to address “white-space” customer issue in the commercial sales and services segment. To predict the interests of customers who are new to a product category, we propose a statistical inference method using customers’ existing purchase records from other product categories, a Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA)-based transfer learning method using customers’ business profile content, and a kernel logistic regression-based model which combines these two recommendations to produce the final results with higher accuracy.

Recommenders aid their users in the decision-making process by providing a list of locations likely to be relevant to the user's needs and interests. Traditional collaborative filtering algorithms consider relationships between users and locations, finding users to be similar only if their location histories overlap. However, the availability of spatial, temporal, and social information in an LBSN offers an opportunity to improve the quality of a recommendation engine. Social network data allows us to connect users who can directly influence each other's decisions. Temporal data allows us to account for the drifting preferences of users, giving more weight to recent location visits over historical selections, and taking advantages of repetitive behaviors. Spatial information allows us to focus recommendations on locations close to the user, keeping our recommendations relevant as a user travels.

M-type subdwarfs are metal-poor low-mass stars and are probes for the old populations in our Galaxy. Accurate knowledge of their atmospheric parameters and especially their composition is essential for understanding the chemical history of our Galaxy. Aims. The purpose of this work is to perform a detailed study of M-subdwarf spectra covering the full wavelength range from the optical to the near-infrared. It allows us to perform a more detailed analysis of the atmospheric composition in order to determine the stellar parameters, and to constrain the atmospheric models. The study will allow us to further understand physical and chemical processes such as increasing condensation of gas into dust, to point out the missing continuum opacities, and to see how the main band features are reproduced by the models. The spectral resolution and the large wavelength coverage used is a unique combination that can constrain the processes that occur in a cool atmosphere. Methods. We obtained medium-resolution spectra (R = 5000-7000) over the wavelength range 0.3-2.5 μm of ten M-type subdwarfs with X-shooter at VLT. These data constitute a unique atlas of M-subdwarfs from optical to near-infrared. We performed a spectral synthesis analysis using a full grid of synthetic spectra computed from BT-Settl models and obtained consistent stellar parameters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity. Results. We show that state-of the-art atmospheric models correctly represent the overall shape of their spectral energy distribution, as well as atomic and molecular line profiles both in the optical and near-infrared.

This heterogeneity makes treatment difficult for caregivers because they cannot accurately predict the way in which the disease will progress in order to guide treatment decisions. Therefore, tools that help to predict the trajectory of these complex chronic diseases can help to improve the quality of health care. To build such tools, we can leverage clinical markers that are collected at baseline when a patient first presents and longitudinally over time during follow-up visits. Because complex chronic diseases are typically systemic, the longitudinal markers often track disease progression in multiple organ systems. In this paper, our goal is to predict a function of time that models the future trajectory of a single target clinical marker tracking a disease process of interest. We want to make these predictions using the histories of many related clinical markers as input. Our proposed solution tackles several key challenges. First, we can easily handle irregularly and sparsely sampled markers, which are standard in clinical data. Second, the number of parameters and the computational complexity of learning our model grows linearly in the number of marker types included in the model. This makes our approach applicable to diseases where many different markers are recorded over time. Finally, our model accounts for latent factors inuencing disease expression, whereas standard regression models rely on observed features alone to explain variability. Moreover, our approach can be applied dynamically in continous-time and updates its predictions as soon as any new data is available. We apply our approach to the problem of predicting lung disease trajectories in scleroderma, a complex autoimmune disease. We show that our model improves over state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy and we provide a qualitative analysis of our model's output. Finally, the variability of disease presentation in scleroderma makes clinical trial recruitment challenging. We show that a prognostic tool that integrates multiple types of routinely collected longitudinal data can be used to identify individuals at greatest risk of rapid progression and to target trial recruitment. © 2016 Peter Schulam and Suchi Saria.","Conditional random fields; Disease trajectories; Gaussian processes; Latent variable models; Precision medicine; Prediction of functional targets","Diagnosis; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Target tracking; Trajectories; Conditional random field; Disease progression; Gaussian Processes; Integrative analysis; Latent variable models; Predictive accuracy; Qualitative analysis; Quality of health care; Diseases",2-s2.0-85011661288

We describe two state-of-the-art authorship verification systems and benchmark them on 6 present-day evaluation corpora, as well as a Latin benchmark dataset.

Engineering Teaching Kit (ETKs) are self-contained STEM education standards-based units grounded in the constructivist philosophy of education and the principles of guided inquiry and active learning. An ETK introduces P-12 students to real-world constraints engineers must consider in developing their designs such as budget, cost, time, risk, reliability, safety, and customer needs and demands. Finally, due to their inherent interdisciplinary approach, the use of ETKs also encourages the integration of other subjects in the curriculum, such as history and language arts, into lesson plans, leading to an efficient and reinforcing project-based learning environment. The featured design challenge is from our newest ETK, Trash Sliders. Students learn about force and motion while designing a vehicle with a suspension system that will allow the vehicle to navigate rough terrain while retaining its payload. The vehicle is constructed from every day items considered trash, thereby bringing considerations of sustainability and meta-recycling into the conversation. The ETK was purposefully designed to be low-cost and accessible. This special session is for those interested in exploring a philosophy of engineering education that stresses an integrative, project-based approach to instruction and practice grounded in design, the fundamental process of engineering.

However, there are few preventive interventions targeting children who are at higher risk for melanoma due to a family history of the disease. Further, there are no educational interventions that aim to help these at-risk children understand their risk for melanoma and the ways in which preventive behaviors, such as sun protection, can mitigate their risk. The current paper describes a multidisciplinary team’s process for creating a developmentally appropriate educational intervention about melanoma risk and prevention for children ages 8–17 years who have a family history of melanoma. Drawing from the fields of dermatology, health behavior change and education, genetic risk communication, science education, and graphic arts, the multimedia intervention created covers key learning points relevant to understanding melanoma, the role of DNA damage in melanoma development, inherited risk factors for melanoma, environmental factors causing DNA damage, and methods for preventing DNA damage, such as sun protective behaviors. Lessons learned during the development of the educational intervention, particularly relevant to multidisciplinary team interactions, are discussed.

Lane takes a unique approach by focusing on the technologies and the new environment in which the digital humanities largely takes place: the digital laboratory. The book provides a brief history of DH, explores and explains the methodologies of past and current DH projects, and offers resources such as detailed case studies and bibliographies. Further, the focus on the digital laboratory space reveals affiliations with the types of research that have traditionally taken place in the sciences, as well as convergences with other fast-growing research spaces, namely innovation labs, fabrication labs, maker spaces, digital media labs, and change labs. The volume highlights the profound transformation of literary studies that is underway, one in which the adoption of powerful technology - and concomitantly being situated within a laboratory environment - is leading to an important re-engagement in the arts and humanities, and a renewed understanding of literary studies in the digital age, as well as a return to large-scale financial investment in humanistic research. It will be useful to students and teachers, as well as administrators and managers in charge of research infrastructure and funding decisions who need an accessible overview of this technological transformation in the humanities.

However, the state-of-the-art treatment for EVD is limited to quarantine and supportive care. The 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, the largest in history, is believed to have caused more than 11,000 fatalities. The countries worst affected are also among the poorest in the world. Given the complexities, time, and resources required for a novel drug development, finding efficient drug discovery pathways is going to be crucial in the fight against future outbreaks. We have developed a Computational Analysis of Novel Drug Opportunities (CANDO) platform based on the hypothesis that drugs function by interacting with multiple protein targets to create a molecular interaction signature that can be exploited for rapid therapeutic repurposing and discovery. We used the CANDO platform to identify and rank FDA-approved drug candidates that bind and inhibit all proteins encoded by the genomes of five different Ebola virus strains. Top ranking drug candidates for EVD treatment generated by CANDO were compared to in vitro screening studies against Ebola virus-like particles (VLPs) by Kouznetsova et al. and genetically engineered Ebola virus and cell viability studies by Johansen et al. to identify drug overlaps between the in virtuale and in vitro studies as putative treatments for future EVD outbreaks. Our results indicate that integrating computational docking predictions on a proteomic scale with results from in vitro screening studies may be used to select and prioritize compounds for further in vivo and clinical testing. This approach will significantly reduce the lead time, risk, cost, and resources required to determine efficacious therapies against future EVD outbreaks.","candock; compound–proteome interaction; drug repurposing and discovery; multitarget docking","antivirus agent; drug approval; drug development; epidemic; food and drug administration; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola; human; legislation and jurisprudence; United States; Antiviral Agents; Disease Outbreaks; Drug Approval; Drug Discovery; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola; Humans; United States; United States Food and Drug Administration",2-s2.0-85020374636

Data about the prevalence of CKD and its association with other diseases is scarce, particularly in HIV-negative individuals. This study estimated the prevalence of CKD in individuals who were either HIV-positive (and ART-naïve) or HIV-negative in an urban Malawian population. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at a HIV Testing and Counselling Centre in Lilongwe, Malawi. Consecutive clients who were ≥18 years and consented to participate were enrolled over a 3-month period. Clients were screened for potential renal disease and other conditions. Their blood pressure was measured, urine examined via dipstick and albumin/creatinine ratio and blood drawn for creatinine, cystatin C and sero-markers for schistosomiasis. Estimated glomerular filtration (EGFR) rate was calculated using a cystatin C-based formula and classified according to the matching CKD stages by K/DOQI (The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative). We performed a descriptive analysis and compared differences between HIV-positive (and ART naïve) and -negative participants. Results: Out of 381 consecutive clients who were approached between January and March 2012, 366 consented and 363 (48% female; 32% HIV-positive) were included in the analysis. Reasons for exclusion were missing samples or previous use of ART. HIV-positive and negative clients did not differ significantly with regard to age, sex or medical history, but they did differ for BMI - 21.3 (±3.4) vs. 24 (±5.1), respectively (p &lt; 0.001). Participants also differed with regard to serum cystatin C levels, but not creatinine. Reduced kidney function (according to CKD stages 2-5) was significantly more frequent 15.5 vs. 3.6%, respectively (p &lt; 0.001) among HIV-positive clients compared to the HIV-negative group. Differences in renal function were most pronounced in the EGFR range 60-89 ml/min/1.73 m2 accompanied by proteinuria with results as 11.2% vs. 1.2%, respectively for clients who were HIV-positive vs. HIV-negative (p = 0.001). Conclusions: Reduced glomerular filtration and/or proteinuria occurred in 15.5% of HIV-positive, and 3.6% of HIV-negative patients in this urban Malawian cohort. Since generalized renal monitoring is not feasible in Malawi or other resource-limited countries, strategies to identify patients at risk for higher stages of CKD and appropriate preventive measures are needed for both HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients. © 2016 The Author(s).","Chronic kidney disease; Glomerular filtration rate; HIV; LMIC; Malawi; Nephrology; Non-communicable diseases; Schistosomiasis; Sub-Saharan Africa","albumin; creatinine; cystatin C; adult; age; Article; blood pressure; body mass; chronic kidney disease; controlled study; cross-sectional study; descriptive research; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; HIV test; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; kidney function; Malawi; male; medical history; prevalence; schistosomiasis; sex difference; urban population; urinalysis",2-s2.0-85002540643

Many research efforts have been devoted in developing new metadata prefetching methods by considering past file access patterns. However, the existing methods do not consider the correlations between processes and the corresponding files(e.g. file provenance). Therefore, the methods cannot obtain very rich and accurate correlations, thus decreasing the effectiveness of metadata prefetching. This paper presents a Provenance-based Metadata Prefetching(ProMP) scheme, which considers both provenance and the past file access patterns. Through mining the correlations between processes and corresponding files from provenance and past access history, ProMP can achieve accurate and rich correlation information. ProMP is conducive to employing aggressive metadata prefetching to boost the performance by leveraging the correlations. Our experimental results show that ProMP performs more effectively with less memory overhead than the existing solutions, while improving the hit rates by up to 49% and 7% in contrast to traditional LRU and a state-of-art metadata prefetching algorithm Nexus, respectively. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Multiprocessing systems; Access history; Caching and prefetching; Distributed storage system; Effective approaches; File access patterns; Memory overheads; Prefetching algorithm; Research efforts; Metadata",2-s2.0-85006783218

The Dr. Peter Centre (DPC) is a non-profit integrated care facility with a supervised injection room that serves PLHIV experiencing multiple barriers to social and health services in Vancouver, Canada. This study examines whether the DPC is successful in drawing in PLHIV with complex health issues, including addiction. Methods: Using data collected by the Longitudinal Investigations into Supportive and Ancillary health services (LISA) study from July 2007 to January 2010, linked with clinical variables available through the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS Drug Treatment Program, we identified DPC and non-DPC clients with a history of injection drug use. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses compared socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of DPC clients (n=76) and non-DPC clients (n=482) with a history of injection drug use. Results: Of the 917 LISA participants included within this analysis, 100 (10.9%) reported being a DPC client, of which 76 reported a history of injection drug use. Adjusted results found that compared to non-DPC clients with a history of injection drug use, DPC-clients were more likely to be male (AOR: 4.18, 95% CI=2.09-8.37); use supportive services daily vs. less than daily (AOR: 3.16, 95% CI=1.79-5.61); to have been diagnosed with a mental health disorder (AOR: 2.11; 95% CI: 1.12-3.99); to have a history of interpersonal violence (AOR: 2.76; 95% CI: 1.23-6.19); and to have ever experienced ART interruption longer than 1year (AOR: 2.39; 95% CI: 1.38-4.15). Conclusions: Our analyses suggest that the DPC operating care model engages PLHIV with complex care needs, highlighting that integrated care facilities are needed to support the multiple intersecting vulnerabilities faced by PLHIV with a history of injection drug use living within urban centres in North America and beyond. © 2016 The Author(s).","Barriers to care; HIV; Injection drug use; Integrated health care; Support services",,2-s2.0-84997514392

For each model, all such graphs for different authors are aggregated to generate a combined weighted training graph. Then a simple graph traversal algorithm is used to compare testing graph with the training graph. The experiment is conducted on the documents of six authors collected from Bengali literature. Experimental results show that our models significantly outperform four state-of-the-art models (9.89% higher than the best baseline model) even for short training dataset. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Learning systems; Authorship attribution; Authorship identification; Bengali language; Graph-based models; Machine learning approaches; Relevant features; Syntactic features; Training dataset; Graphic methods",2-s2.0-85006778844

Underpinned by international contexts, this book is rooted in British art and design education and draws upon contemporary case studies of teaching and learning in post-compulsory settings in order to analyse and illustrate identities and practices of CCS and its integration. The chapters in this book are divided into three sections that build on one another: 'Discourse and debate'; 'Models, types and tensions'; and 'Proposals and recommendations'. Key issues include: knowledge hierarchies and subject histories and identities; constructions of 'theory' and the symbiotic relationship between theory and practice; models and practices of CCS within current post-compulsory British art and design education; the reification of ubiquitous terms in the fields of art and design and of education: intuition and integration; approaches to curriculum integration, including design and management; and suggestions for integrating CCS in art and design courses, including implications for pedagogy and assessment. Integrating Critical and Contextual Studies in Art and Design offers a comprehensive analysis of the current drive towards integration within art education, and elucidates what we understand by the theory and practice of integration. It explores the history, theory, teaching and student experience of CCS, and will be of interest to lecturers, teachers and pedagogues involved in art and design as well as researchers and students of art education. © 2017 Jenny Rintoul.

Although these movements shared a common vocabulary and rhetoric, they contrasted sharply in their aims and objectives. I address three interrelated questions: How were these movements and their ideologies related to, and perceived by, the ruling elites? What were their mutual influences and inspirational centre? Did both movements share a broader core ideology? To answer these questions, I explore the links, parallels and dissimilarities between anarchism and Futurism in the context of the nationalist mass mobilizations preceding World War I. In line with Emilio Gentile’s landmark analysis, I identify the core ideology of Futurism as a potent blend of nationalism and modernism. Futurism’s double matrix is thus contrasted with the theory and practice of anarchism, the two displaying sharply differing relationships with political power. I also consider the links between Italian Futurism and French ultra-nationalism as championed by prominent intellectuals, beyond Paris’ artistic epicentre, where art and politics intermixed. I conclude that the fusion of modernism and nationalism was central to twentieth-century ideological radicalization to which Futurism fully belonged, but from which anarchism eventually dissociated itself. © 2016 International Society for the Study of European Ideas.","Anarchism; Arts and politics; Futurism; History of political ideologies; Modernism; Nationalism; War",,2-s2.0-84966700395

In this article, the drawing and its creation serve to illustrate not only Freud’s theories concerning the creation of images and imagery, but equally something meaningful about Freud himself. As will become clear, these Freudian theories, drawn from concepts in The Interpretation of Dreams, the papers on metatheory, and a random selection of Freud’s own poetic word images, reveal not only Freud’s interpretive presence but also his personal absence. Challenging Freud's interpretation of the drawing as confirming the Wolf-Man's childhood dream, this article presents potential imagery of the drawing as seen through the lenses of post-Freudian psychoanalytic authors as well as an intriguing quote by art historian Whitney Davis.

Radiation instantly became the subject not only of numerous scientific papers but also of circus bazaars, poetry, fiction, costume design, comics, and marketing for household items. Its spread was “viral.” What is not well known, however, is its incorporation into visual art, despite the long tradition of medicine and surgery as a subject in art. Using several contemporary search methods, we identified 5 examples of paintings or sculpture that thematically feature radiation therapy. All were by artists with exhibited careers in art: Georges Chicotot, Marcel Duchamp, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Robert Pope, and Cookie Kerxton. Each artist portrays radiation differently, ranging from traditional healer, to mysterious danger, to futuristic propaganda, to the emotional challenges of undergoing cancer therapy. This range captures the complex role of radiation as both a therapy and a hazard. Whereas some of these artists are now world famous, none of these artworks are as well known as their surgical counterparts. The penetration of radiation into popular culture was rapid and pervasive; yet, its role as a thematic subject in art never fully caught on, perhaps because of a lack of understanding of the technology, radiation's intangibility, or even a suppressive effect of society's ambivalent relationship with it. These 5 artists have established a rich foundation upon which pop culture and art can further develop with time to reflect the extraordinary progress of modern radiation therapy. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",,"Radiation; Surgery; Cancer therapy; Complex roles; Pop culture; Popular cultures; Scientific advances; Scientific papers; Search method; Visual arts; Radiotherapy; cancer therapy; career; human; painting; priority journal; propaganda; radiation; radiotherapy; Review; traditional healer; art; folklore; history; literature; Neoplasms; painting; publication; radiation oncology; radium; Folklore; History, 20th Century; Humans; Medicine in Art; Medicine in Literature; Neoplasms; Paintings; Posters as Topic; Radiation Oncology; Radium; X-Ray Therapy",2-s2.0-84992530854

Water-based highly viscous polymeric dispersions (HVPD) composed by partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate (PVA), borax, and water, were recently developed and successfully applied for the selective removal of surface degradation patinas (i.e. protein materials, natural resins etc.) from paintings of historical and artistic interest. This approach is here coupled for the first time to a SPR biosensor to simultaneously recognize albumen, yolk, or their mixtures in HVPD extracts. Ovalbumin and immunoglobulin Y are selected as analytes for egg white and yolk recognition, respectively. The biosensor was first characterized on standard analytes within the range 0-400 mg L-1 and then on fresh and dried egg albumen and yolk down to 2·10^4 and 1·10^5 dilution factors, respectively. Once optimized, the biosensor was combined to the HVPD application on simulated and real art samples for the evaluation of hen egg presence in the extract, i.e. albumen, yolk, or their co-presence in the matrix. For a contemporary 'sacred icon', realized by the traditional egg tempera procedure described by Cennino Cennini, the biosensor successfully distinguished different uses of egg components for the realization of painted and gilded areas, i.e. yolk and albumen, respectively.

Sun as a primary source of light has been studied for centuries with gradually accumulating knowledge concerning the sun position on the sky vault in different geographical locations and various time periods. Extraterrestrial solar energy flow towards the Earth's atmosphere was determined in the form of the Solar Constant and horizontal sunlight illuminance under various changes in time, solar altitude and atmospheric conditions. Skylight from the whole sky vault is the largest spacious source of diffuse daylighting in building interiors. Historic achievements of its determination by sky luminance patterns was first defined by Lambert with unity uniform sky luminance as the simplest standard with the possibility of determining relative Sky Factor criterion. Modelling of the whole range of sky types is possible by applying gradation luminance patterns and determination of their gradation functions, with scattering of sun beams in different space directions and is determined by indicatrix functions. Relative luminance sky patterns of different sky types is now standardized and normalized by zenith luminance. However, it is possible to define zenith luminance and horizontal illuminance in absolute physical units, thus to change daylight criteria from relative values of the Daylight Factor to interior physical illuminance in lux.

There is also a rapid increase of HIV among women. The latter might be due to high levels of sero-discordant couples and increasing transmission from male to female partners over time. Methods: All adult married patients initiating antiretroviral treatment at four out-patient clinics in Quang Ninh province in north-eastern Vietnam between 2007 and 2009 were asked to participate in the study. Clinical information was extracted from patients' records, and a structured questionnaire was used to collect social, demographic and economic data. Results: Two hundred eighty-eight married patients for whom information on the HIV status of their spouse was available were included in the study. Overall, the sero-discordance rate was 58%. The sero-discordance rate was significantly higher among married males, 71% had spouses not infected, than married females, of whom 18% had spouses not infected. Other factors associated with a high rate of sero-discordance were injection drug use (IDU) history, tuberculosis (TB) history and the availability of voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) in residential locations. High sero-concordance was associated with college/university education. Conclusion: The sero-discordance was significantly higher among married males than married females. Other factors also related to high sero-discordance were history of IDU, history of TB and the availability of VCT in residential locations. In contrast, college/university education and female sex were significantly related to low sero-discordance. To contain the increasing HIV prevalence among women, measures should be taken to prevent transmission among sero-discordant couples.

The proposed algorithm, namely LSHADE-EpSin, uses a new ensemble sinusoidal approach to automatically adapt the values of the scaling factor of the Differential Evolution algorithm. This ensemble approach consists of a mixture of two sinusoidal formulas: A non-Adaptive Sinusoidal Decreasing Adjustment and an adaptive History-based Sinusoidal Increasing Adjustment. The objective of this sinusoidal ensemble approach is to find an effective balance between the exploitation of the already found best solutions, and the exploration of non-visited regions.

Three types of subpopulations mimicking the states of B-cells are introduced. Among them, innate population globally explores the promising area, while adaptive population locally searches the optima, and the memory population reuses the history information. Moreover, activation rule is brought to transfer the global search to local search and suppression works for eliminating the redundancy.

This population construction strategy based on memory is motivated by the fact that a population with good quality and diversity can generally help to generate more promising new solutions. In this strategy, the non-dominated solutions obtained by each solution are memorized in an archive and subsequently a construction method is proposed to select solutions with good quality and diversity from the union of all archives to construct the new population. This strategy is incorporated into an adaptive MODE with multiple mutation operators. Computational results on benchmark problems show that the proposed strategy can significantly improve the search efficiency of MODE with traditional population update strategy. The results also reveal that the proposed MODE is superior to some state-of-the-art MODEs and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms in the literature. © 2016 IEEE.","Differential evolution; Memory based population construction; Multi-objective optimization","Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Bench-mark problems; Computational results; Construction strategies; Differential Evolution; Differential evolutionary; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Multi-objective differential evolution algorithms; Nondominated solutions; Evolutionary algorithms",2-s2.0-85008245688

One reason for this could be the lack of robustness in real world situations, especially regarding unimodal recognition technologies like speech and gesture, that tend to produce erroneous inputs that can not be detected by the subsequent multimodal input fusion mechanism. Previous work implying the possibility to detect and overcome such errors through knowledge of individual temporal behaviors has neither provided a real-time implementation nor evaluated the real benefit of such an approach. We present such an implementation of applying individual interaction histories in order to increase the robustness of multimodal inputs within a smartwatch scenario. We show how such knowledge can be created and maintained at runtime, present evaluation data from an experiment conducted in a realistic scenario, and compare the approach to the state of the art known from literature. Our approach is ready to use in other applications and existing systems, with the prospect to increase the overall robustness of future multimodal systems. © 2016 ACM.","HCI; Input error detection; Interaction history; Multimodal interaction; Robustness increase; User behavior","Human computer interaction; Interactive computer systems; Man machine systems; Real time control; Speech recognition; Interaction history; Multi-Modal Interactions; Multimodal input fusion; Multimodal inputs; Real world situations; Real-time implementations; Realistic scenario; User behaviors; Behavioral research",2-s2.0-85003533275

What Christ means can only be explained with reference to God and vice versa; what God stands for in a Christian sense has to be explained with reference to Jesus Christ and not with reference to generic religious terms. Christology thus informs and forms the Christian understanding of how to relate God and reality. Therefore,Christology has to be developed as combinatory Christology bringing different dimensions of reality including scientific and evolutionary perspectives into creative interplay. Theology is an ‘art of combination’ (Dalferth 1991: 18),which in ever new ways relates traditions of faith with theoretical and historical knowledge in order to find relevant ways of understanding God’s presence in the world,to articulate the Christian faith in a meaningful way and to form our ways of living in such a way as to conform to God’s passion for the life of God’s creatures.

By surveying the complete correspondence, author Alison Wiggins uncovers the wide range of uses to which Bess put letters: they were vital to her engagement in the overlapping realms of politics, patronage, business, legal negotiation, news-gathering and domestic life. Much more than a case study of Bess's letters, the discussions of language, handwriting and materiality found here have fundamental implications for the way we approach and read Renaissance letters. Wiggins offers readings which show how Renaissance letters communicated meaning through the interweaving linguistic, palaeographic and material forms, according to socio-historical context and function. The study goes beyond the letters themselves and incorporates a range of historical sources to situate circumstances of production and reception, which include Account Books, inventories, needlework and textile art and architecture.

Through the production of a series of three murals on a university campus, this project was designed to explore the significance of country for three Darug artists working alongside 90 pre-service teachers enrolled in teacher education. The authors were working with the notion that Aboriginal art comes from country and should stay on country; hence, the painting was directed by Darug artists because we were teaching and learning on Darug country.

A novel hyperspectral camera and analysis platform (HySCAP) is presented in this paper, integrating innovative electrooptic solutions and advanced spectral analysis and classification algorithms. This combination offers and attractive alternative to a variety of destructive or ionizing methods used routinely for material identification. HySCAP acquires millions of reflectance and/or fluorescence spectra and tens of narrow band images, spanning the entire 370nm-1100nm wide spectral range. Specially developed and integrated into the HySCAP spectral analysis and system's training tools maximizes the obtained information with regard to the target-object's composition and structure. We have validated the HySCAP concept in a series of painting material replicas and in paintings belonging to El Greco's workshop, made by either the master himself or his students. Painting material replicas were developed following the original development processes and their fluorescence and reflectance spectra were measured and stored in the HySCAP's database. Some of them were used as training set and some other as validation set. The properly designed spectral analysis module was employed for handling the automated comparison of the training set of spectra with the spectra collected from the validation set of samples. Particularly, a series of algorithms for performing spectral comparison and classification were comparatively evaluated. It was found that the best performing algorithm was the Maximum Likelihood algorithm, which displayed accuracies within the range 80.3%-99.7% in identifying and mapping materials in El Greco's workshop paintings. The obtained results indicate that the HySCAP integrated approach emerges as a valuable scientific instrument for developing a series of more efficient methods in the broad field of nondestructive testing. In the particular case of the artwork analysis, which is presented in this paper, the offered new insight into the material composition, technique of construction, deterioration effects, authentication etc., are of essential importance in art history, in authentication and in determining the optimum preservation scheme. © 2016 IEEE.","Classification; El Greco; Hyper spectral Imaging","Authentication; Cameras; Classification (of information); Fluorescence; Imaging systems; Instrument testing; Mapping; Maximum likelihood; Nondestructive examination; Reflection; Spectroscopy; Spectrum analysis; Classification algorithm; El Greco; Hyper-spectral cameras; Hyperspectral Imaging; Material compositions; Material identification; Maximum likelihood algorithm; Spectroscopic technique; Spectroscopic analysis",2-s2.0-85004010211

The article aims to survey the pivotal implementations, starting from the early days of the Republic, and brings close together an evaluative reading about what has been done to keep the Turkish higher education in fine arts relative and up to date. Consequently, the main focus has been on and about the manifold complexities that arose as a result of such pitfalls like the absence—and in some cases, also the presence—of mandatory legislative frameworks, art's and art education's assumed role and promise in the university context and the both mutual and separate motives of academics and students in the field. It can be said that the symptomatic qualities put forward a set of associations in-between those issues, causing a similarity among the key problems. Most apparent of those are about to be on the difficulty of translation—from one expression, structure, history, modality, experience or body of knowledge into another. Thus, the futility and dulling caused by the widespread institutional and individual custom of metaphrasing could be identified as a core issue whereas the necessity to paraphrase and to contextualize gains critical urgency. The concept of artistic research discussed in this context is a possible mode of structuring and programming the art education itself that could, it is hoped, be antidotal to the existing alienating and anaesthetic practice—which becomes especially significant today in a public institutional education environment that is expected to assure a free, relevant and worthy higher arts education that still has a chance to avoid the distorting restraints faced extensively by the private sector. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,,2-s2.0-85000671298

Such an emphasis on already-existing relations has consequences for the conduct of publicly-funded interventions including socially engaged research projects. This article tells a part of the story of one such project in Peterborough, England in the 2010s. If the project was counter-cultural in working with what was already happening in the city, rather than seeking to proselytize a culturally specific view of citizenship and the arts, it also faced its own political choices regarding whose work to accompany and how. Initiated by a group of outsider academics and artists, it involved transformations at varying scales, both fleeting and longer-lasting, often unplanned. The article takes a look at the project's own micro-sociality in the choices city residents made to accompany its intentions and practices.

Particular technical traces left on the medium by the act of engraving were identified through microscopic analysis and used to build a quantitative estimation of the overall technical aptitude of the engraver. Some traces considered as accidents or errors in the tracing were counted negatively, whereas others reflecting control of the tool and mastership in the use of various techniques were counted positively. A multivariate analysis based on this quantitative index, along with criteria including the type of medium was carried out using Correspondence Factor Analysis and completed with relevant statistical tests. The analysis clearly distinguishes three groups of pieces: those with a negative index, those that present a low positive index resulting from a balance between positive and negative traces, and those with a highly positive index. These different categories of pieces may be tentatively assigned to different levels of experience in tool control and engraving techniques. The mean value of the technical index seems to be correlated with the type of medium and differs significantly in the various sites studied in the corpus. These data allow us to pose some hypotheses concerning the transmission of knowledge in Magdalenian societies, such as differential access to raw materials according to the engraver's experience, and different functionality of sites based on their production of decorated objects. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cantabrian Region; Correspondence Factor Analysis; Magdalenian; Microscopic analysis; Portable art; Pyrenees; Technical skill","archaeological evidence; art; artifact; cultural history; human settlement; learning; Paleolithic; tool use; Cantabria; Pyrenees; Spain",2-s2.0-84992151471

Only within the last two decades have art historians, in an interdisciplinary effort with other scholars, drawn attention to this deficit through such anti-Eurocentric investigations as Postcolonialism or Afro-Modernism.

This development was, for instance, manifest in the dress and titles of the rulers of the Vijayanagara empire. As has been argued, they bore the title of sultan and on public occasions they appeared in garments fashioned on Persian and Arab clothing. Both adaptations exemplified efforts to connect to the dominant Indo-Islamic world. From Vijayanagara's fragmentation in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, new Hindu-ruled kingdoms arose. We may wonder to what extent those succeeding polities continued practices adopted from Islamic courts. With that question in mind, this article discusses royal dress at court audiences in four Vijayanagara successor states, chiefly on the basis of embassy reports of the Dutch East India Company and South Indian works of art. It appears that kings could wear a variety of clothing styles at audiences and that influences on these styles now came from multiple backgrounds, comprising diverse Islamic and other elements. Further, not all successor states followed the same dress codes, as their dynasties modified earlier conventions in different ways, depending on varying political developments. © Copyright 2016 Cambridge University Press.",,"art; cultural history; eighteenth century; ethnopolitics; historical perspective; Islamism; political development; seventeenth century; India",2-s2.0-84976524480

Conclusions: SCM has a rich history and has intrigued physicians for over 200 years. Many well-known figures from the past such as Chiari and von Recklinghausen, both pathologists, made early postmortem descriptions of SCM. With the advent of MRI, these pathological embryological derailments can now often be detected and appreciated early and during life.

Method: Eighteen occupational therapists experienced and educated in art therapy participated. The experts answered three rounds of Delphi questionnaires and ranked their agreement with 74 assertions. Consensus was defined as 70% or higher. Results: The experts agreed more on assertions about theoretical frames of reference than about clinical practice. The main aspects of art therapy were agreed to be the patients’ opportunity to express themselves verbally and through making art. It was equally important that art tasks provided an opportunity to address depressive thoughts, feelings, life experiences, and physical symptoms.

Somnambulism was still a mysterious condition during this time, since its pathogenesis was unknown. Hence, it comes as no surprise that somnambulism features in a number of operas, the best known of which are Verdi's 'Macbeth' and Bellini's 'La Sonnambula', both the subject of recent scholarship. Here we examine a more obscure opera in which sleepwalking is depicted. Dating from 1824, 'Il Sonnambulo' by the Italian composer Michele Carafa is based on a libretto by Felice Romani. Although it shares some features with the Verdi and Bellini operas, it also presents original elements. Our analysis of this forgotten opera supports the contention that studying operas can shed light on medical theories and practices, and on how ideas about mind and body disorders were transmitted to the laity in times past. © 2016 S.

However, his main contribution to Lister’s work was in the embryonic field of bacteriology in the 1870s–1890s, which brought him into contact with continental researchers, particularly Robert Koch (1843–1910). In this field, Cheyne built an independent reputation as an assessor, chronicler and promoter of continental laboratory methodology. He pioneered bacteriological training in British teaching hospitals and incorporated laboratory testing into case notes as standard procedure. This paper reconsiders Cheyne’s contribution to the development of bacteriology in British medicine at the end of the 19th century. It examines his motives in promoting new laboratory techniques and the methods he used to embed them in hospital procedure. It also considers how he continued to use bacteriological arguments to keep the Listerian antiseptic principle on the medical agenda well after Lister withdrew from active involvement in the field. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","bacteriology; laboratory methodology; Lister; Listerian antisepsis; microbes; Robert Koch; Shetland; Watson Cheyne","antisepsis; art; bacteriology; education; history; standards; United Kingdom; Antisepsis; Bacteriology; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; United Kingdom",2-s2.0-85010297234

The diagnosis of early arteriosclerosis that was considered at the time a physiological, irreversible ailment of ageing had a strong emotional impact on Cajal. Comorbid depression, insomnia and self-treatment with escalating doses of Veronal® (barbital), a short-acting barbiturate, presumably aggravated the situation. Exposure to warm environments and being involved in tense discussions were identified as triggering factors of the headaches. Achúcarro and Cajal were probably assuming scientific concepts at the time, such as cerebral congestion, increased temperature at the cerebral cortex during mental activity and vasoconstriction and vasodilatation phenomena. Up to his death aged 82, no evidence was discovered of any organic nervous system disorder. Cajal remained anxious up to the end of his life fearing an impending cerebral haemorrhage. The diagnosis was followed by profound lifestyle changes such as social isolation, which forced him to leave his laboratory.
