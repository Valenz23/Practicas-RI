However natural resource rents provided different impact on the economic growth or economic profit. The main focus of the study was to evaluate the economic growth as function of natural resource rents. For such a purpose machine learning approach, artificial neural network, was used. The used natural resource rents were coal rents, forest rents, mineral rents, natural gas rents and oil rents. Based on the results it is concluded that the machine learning approach could be used as the tool for the economic growth evaluation as function of natural resource rents. Moreover the more advanced approaches should be incorporated to improve more the forecasting accuracy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Economic growth; Evaluation; Natural resources rents,Artificial intelligence; Coal deposits; Economic and social effects; Function evaluation; Learning systems; Natural gas deposits; Natural resources; Neural networks; Profitability; Business economics; Economic growths; Economic profit; Economic rent; Evaluation; Forecasting accuracy; Machine learning approaches; Resource rents; Economics,2-s2.0-85030785797

This MIPS supports development of a Decision Support System (DSS) that considers product quality, process productivity and production costs. A case study is described that used the MIPS to make better investment decisions. The MIPS has proven, in practice, to be effective in several applications; for example, in defining the maintenance policy for critical equipment in an iron ore concentration plant; the process for removing impurities and simulating the company's budget to evaluate the viability of different business plans. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",O.R. in natural resources; Production; Simulation; Systems thinking,Artificial intelligence; Budget control; Decision support systems; Maintenance; Production; Stochastic systems; Decision support system (dss); Investment decisions; Iron ore concentration; Maintenance policy; Process productivity; Process simulations; Simulation; Systems thinking; Investments,2-s2.0-85025611491

Various BI models exist for this purpose but the reliability of those models is questionable due to less focus on technical aspects. The purpose of this research is to build comprehensive and reliable Enterprise Business Intelligence Maturity (EBIM) model by using systematic and methodical design. This research investigated and explained problems of existing BI models and solved them by using systematic process through Delphi technique. Three dimensions namely process, technology and organization were considered to develop a mature model. This research concluded that comprehensiveness and reliability of EBIM model enable BI organizations to better plan, assess, and manage their BI initiatives. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2018.",Business intelligence model; Organization; Process; Technology,Competitive intelligence; Information analysis; Processing; Societies and institutions; Technology; Wireless telecommunication systems; Business information; Business intelligence systems; Delphi technique; Methodical designs; Systematic management; Systematic process; Technical aspects; Three dimensions; Information management,2-s2.0-85022226122

The big data problem means that data is growing at a much faster rate than computational speeds. And it is the result of the fact that storage cost is getting cheaper day by day, so people as well as almost all business or scientific organizations are storing more and more data. Social activities, scientific experiments, biological explorations along with the sensor devices are great big data contributors. Big data is beneficial to the society and business but at the same time, it brings challenges to the scientific communities. The existing traditional tools, machine learning algorithms, and techniques are not capable of handling, managing, and analyzing big data, although various scalable machine learning algorithms, techniques, and tools (e.g., Hadoop and Apache Spark open source platforms) are prevalent. In this paper, we have identified the most pertinent issues and challenges related to big data and point out a comprehensive comparison of various techniques for handling big data problem. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Apache Spark; Big data; Big data analytics; Business intelligence; Hadoop MapReduce; Online social networks,Artificial intelligence; Competitive intelligence; Data handling; Digital storage; Information analysis; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Social networking (online); Comprehensive comparisons; Data analytics; Hadoop MapReduce; Issues and challenges; On-line social networks; Open source platforms; Scalable machine learning; Scientific experiments; Big data,2-s2.0-85031400676
