"Hung I.-C., Kinshuk, Chen N.-S.",Embodied interactive video lectures for improving learning comprehension and retention,2018,Computers and Education,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032475969&doi=10.1016%2fj.compedu.2017.10.005&partnerID=40&md5=12d667409ba0698150d17f558c8a8563,"The increased interaction with multimedia content has been recognized as a significant factor to improve learners’ learning outcomes. As a result, interactive video lectures are increasingly being adopted in digital learning contexts for increasing interactivity. However, conventional video lecture lacks interactive learning activities (ILAs) that are an indispensable component of interactivity. Interactive video lectures can provide learners opportunities to obtain timely constructive support to produce effective learning outcomes because of ILAs. In order to carefully design and create ILAs for effective learning, instructors need to invest substantial efforts for conceiving the content and interactions of ILAs. This study proposed an approach to design the content of ILAs by leveraging collective intelligence (CI) gathered from the discussion forums specifically related to the content of video lectures. When learners exercised ILAs, meaningful interactions by speaking and gesturing worked as learning support to improve comprehension of learning materials. To evaluate the effects of the CI-based ILAs, an experiment was conducted with 90 university students, who were randomly and equally assigned to three different groups (i.e., embodied interactive, non-embodied interactive, and conventional video lectures). The results show that learners who learned with the embodied interactive video lecture performed better in comprehension and retention of learning contents than the other two counter groups. The findings also revealed that this approach does not impose any additional cognitive load on learners. The design guidelines derived in this study can serve as reference for instructors to create interactive video lectures with CI-based ILAs in digital learning contexts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Architectures for educational technology system; Human-computer interface; Interactive learning environments; Pedagogical issues; Teaching/learning strategies,Computer aided instruction; Computer graphics; E-learning; Educational technology; Human computer interaction; Learning systems; Teaching; Architectures for educational technology system; Human computer interfaces; Interactive learning environment; Pedagogical issues; Teaching/learning strategy; Education,2-s2.0-85032475969

The primary advantage of this method over correlative methods is that it can tell us if a certain brain region is necessary for a given cognitive function. In addition, lesion-based analyses provide unique insights into clinical deficits. In the last decade, statistical voxel-based lesion behavior mapping (VLBM) emerged as a powerful method for understanding the architecture of the human brain. This review illustrates how VLBM improves our knowledge of functional brain architecture, as well as how it is inherently limited by its mass-univariate approach. A wide array of recently developed methods appear to supplement traditional VLBM. This paper provides an overview of these new methods, including the use of specialized imaging modalities, the combination of structural imaging with normative connectome data, as well as multivariate analyses of structural imaging data. We see these new methods as complementing rather than replacing traditional VLBM, providing synergistic tools to answer related questions. Finally, we discuss the potential for these methods to become established in cognitive neuroscience and in clinical applications. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Cognitive neurology; Human; Lesion analysis; Machine learning; Mass-univariate; MLBM; Multivariate lesion behavior mapping; Network; Neuroanatomy; Neuropsychology; Non-parametric mapping; Stroke; VLBM; VLSM; Voxel-based lesion symptom mapping,gadolinium; BOLD signal; brain blood flow; brain mapping; cerebrovascular accident; cognition; connectome; diagnostic accuracy; diffusion weighted imaging; emotion; episodic memory; functional magnetic resonance imaging; glioblastoma; human; machine learning; perfusion weighted imaging; population research; priority journal; Review; temporal lobe epilepsy; voxel based lesion behavior mapping; voxel based morphometry,2-s2.0-85032203415

Existing TIA techniques and algorithms perform limited cognitive processing because they lack fundamental characteristics of Situation Management (SM). In consequence, a dramatic reduction of situation awareness, information and decision superiority of the operators and the overall tactical system has emerged. Considerable attention in applying computational cognitive architectures and processing and SM within TIA has been gaining momentum. This paper discusses the Cognitive Architecture for Tactical Information Assessment (CATIA), a proposed Multi-Agent System (MAS)-based cognitive architecture. CATIA employs cognitive architecture design principles and the Belief, Desire and Intention (BDI) framework to facilitate recognition and reasoning to deliberate in tactical situations and events. CATIA will be implemented within the Future Integrated Mission System (FIMS) to illustrate how superior TIA methodologies can dramatically improve information assessment, situation awareness and information and decision superiority within tactical systems. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",Belief; Cognitive architectures; Desire and intention; Multi-agent systems; Situation awareness; Situation management; Tactical information assessment,Cognitive systems; Computer architecture; Information management; Belief; Cognitive architectures; Desire and intention; Situation awareness; Situation management; Tactical information; Multi agent systems,2-s2.0-85020379371

We start by understanding the sensors and actuators available in the NPC and how to control it inside the game. Then, we introduce the main foundations of CST: Codelets and Memories, and how they should be used to integrate a cognitive architecture. Then, we start building specific codelets and memories for a simple instance of the CST Reference Cognitive Architecture and start using it to control the NPC. The lab is a hands-on programming lab, using Java and Netbeans as language/tool. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",Cognitive architecture; CST; Tutorial; Virtual environment,,2-s2.0-85028338815
